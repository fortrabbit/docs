## Get ready

Have a basic

### 1. Tell fortrabbit about your domain

1. Click New > "Add a new domain" and follow the steps
2. Choose a domain name and an environment
3. After saving, keep the window open for the DNS settings

### 2 Point the domain to fortrabbit with your DNS provider

Use the provided DNS information from the fortrabbit dashboard to change the domain routing with your domain provider.

* Change the A Record to use the provided IP
* Leave any other records untouched, especially MX
* Remove any AAAA records

Save the settings with your domain provider and wait a while. The while depends on the TTL settings of the DNS records, or usually up to 6h.
