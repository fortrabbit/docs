## Use the dashboard as a guidance

When visiting your domain within the [dashboard](/14.concepts/dashboard.md), you'll see the desired and the currently active settings of the domain. In general — when not using an external DNS service like Cloudflare — those two settings should match.

## Use dig to verify current DNS values

You can verify DNS settings with the [dig command](/11.dev-tips/dig.md).

## No DNS settings

Depending on your browser you might see a _DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN_ or _This site can't be reached_ or _This webpage is not available_ error. In such cases, it is likely that the domain is not registered or there are no DNS settings for that domain. You need to fix that with your domain provider.

## Time delays

Many DNS providers default the TTL (Time To Live) of all records to 24 hours. This means that all changes will be applied with a delay of up to 24 hours, because everybody who has looked up the domain caches the result for the TTL duration. Also the TTL is not guaranteed: One badly programmed router on the way, who ignores the TTL or imposes its own minimal TTL, can change the TTL for everybody "behind it". The caching itself is actually a good thing as it helps to reduce round trips. Some providers let you set down the TTL, which is very useful when moving or changing domains.
