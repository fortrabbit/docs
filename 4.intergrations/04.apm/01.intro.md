Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools are essential for professional software development. They help you look inside your running application to identify performance bottlenecks, slow database queries, and runtime errors. Instead of guessing why your app is slow, APM tools give you data-driven insights to optimize your code effectively.

## Supported services

fortrabbit currently offers native integration for two leading APM solutions:

* [New Relic](02.new-relic.md)
* [Blackfire](03.blackfire.md)

These integrations are easy to enable via the dashboard. Other APM tools that require custom PHP extensions or root access are not supported at this time, but we are looking into this.
