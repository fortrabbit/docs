## About domain registration

Domain registration is the process of acquiring a web address for a website - a Top Level Domain. To do this, you need to go through a domain registrar, which will check availability and let you purchase the domain, usually for a year in advance. Once registered, you can link the domain to your fortrabbit environments by setting appropriate DNS records.

With classical shared and VPS hosting, domain registration and e-mail hosting were often bundled in packages. Today you can find dedicated services. There are various offerings, so you should consider upfront what you'll need. We look at:

1. Specialized in advanced DNS configurations
2. IMAP/POP3 e-mail accounts - see [email providers](/4.intergrations/05.email/01.email-providers.md)
3. Exotic TLD-endings
4. General domain forwarding with HTTPS
5. Support for forwards with [ALIAS or ANAME records](/1.platform/13.dns/aname-alias-records.md)

Many of our clients are using classical offerings combining domain ordering and e-mail hosting. Others are using separate services for domain registration and e-mail hosting, there are also dedicated services that only offer DNS.

## Pointing a domain to fortrabbit

See the [external domain configuration](/1.platform/13.dns/2.external-domain-setup.md) for a general guide on how to set this up.
