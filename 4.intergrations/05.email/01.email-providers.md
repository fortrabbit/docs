## About email account

There are two types of email services you may require to run your business, but which are not included with fortrabbit services:

1. **Email accounts for you humans**, this article
2. Emails sent from your application, see [transaction mails](/4.intergrations/02.transactional-mail/01.intro.md)

## Integration with fortrabbit

There is actually no connection between fortrabbit and your email account provider. You need to connect the mail provider with your external domain. Just point the MX (DNS) records to the email provider.

## Email account provider types

There are roughly two paths to host email accounts with your own domain:

- Classical web-hosting packages often include domain registration and e-mail services. Some [domain providers](/4.intergrations/01.dns/01.intro.md) also offer email accounts.
- A dedicated email service may has advanced features such as office integration, team management, a more fancy mail client, backups …

## Considerations

- Privacy and security
- GEO location
- Pricing
