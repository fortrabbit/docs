## Support scope

Most support tickets are getting filed by developers regarding questions on development and platform usage. Clients also contact us for billing related questions.

## Starting a support ticket

Our support is driven by Intercom (external service).

To start a conversation, open the chat bubble on the bottom right corner. Signed-in users are automatically registered and can submit new tickets and view history on previously opened tickets.

Our AI will try answer your question based on these docs and previous support cases, if that doesn't help, a human will pick up.

Sometimes human support is live chat. At other times we will come back on you as soon as possible. We will always answer. Please provide sufficient details.
