## Booking traffic

Traffic measures the data transfer that is caused by visitors browsing around your website.

## Configuring traffic

There is no traffic configuration, but the dashboard shows current usage metrics.

## Scaling traffic

Traffic is a passive component. It just happens. The max usage is billed over the month. It's designed in tiers and as most websites have predictable traffic patterns you can expect the same costs monthly. 89% websites hosted here stay on the lowest tier.

### Autoscaling

Autoscaling is available. When turned on (default), the next tier will be booked automatically once the current limit is reached, you will be billed more. When turned off, the website will go offline, once the limit is reached.

### Tip: Avoid website obesity

Keep the footprint of your website slim. Send as few bytes over the wire as possible, so that you can serve more visitors with the same amount of traffic. Reducing your website weight will also make it load faster for your visitors and improve your SEO score.
