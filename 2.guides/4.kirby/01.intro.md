## Understand flat file systems

Unlike [WordPress](/2.guides/4.wordpress) or [Craft CMS](/2.guides/3.craft-cms) Kirby is a file based CMS. So there is no database, the actual contents are markdown text files written on the file system. Other flat file systems are [Grav](/2.guides/7.more/7.grav.md) and [Statamic](/2.guides/5.statamic/01.install.md). In general, this design approach makes things more easy, but also has some gotchas.

## License model

Kirby CMS is open source, but not free software. You can test it for free. Support the authors and the longevity of the project by obtaining a license for production.

## Deployment options

Special consideration should be taken when deploying Kirby CMS. We assume you have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) running. Now from time

- [Git + rsync deployment](/2.guides/4.kirby/03.git-and-rsync.md) - advanced, sophisticated, recommended
- [rsync sync](/2.guides/4.kirby/02.rsync.md) - advanced, quick
- SFTP upload - easy peasy, see [general SFTP article](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md)
