## Choose a deployment workflow

- [Git + rsync deployment](/2.guides/4.kirby/03.git-and-rsync.md) - recommended, most sophisticated
- [rsync deployment](/2.guides/4.kirby/04.rsync.md) - advanced, quick
- SFTP upload - simple, see [general SFTP article](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md)
- Git only - Use when the remote admin panel is not required
