## Get ready

- Have a [local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md)
- See the [official Kirby docs quick start installation](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/quickstart#installing-kirby) as well

If you already have a local Kirby project, continue with [deployment options](/2.guides/4.kirby/02.deployment-options.md).

### Kirby starter kits

Kirby has different starting points for new projects:

- [Plainkit](https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit): with no contents at all (which is used here).
- [Starterkit](https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit): with demo contents and a theme with some templates
- [Composerkit](https://github.com/getkirby/composerkit): best for git/composer. Adjust [root path](/1.platform/06.settings/12.root-path.md) to `public`.

Our instructions will use Plainkit. Composerkit is the future (we think).

## A: Install Kirby locally with Composer (recommended)

```shell
# 1. Create a local Kirby project folder with Composer:
$ composer create-project getkirby/plainkit {{app-env-id}}
```

## B: Install Kirby locally without Composer

```shell
# Make a directory and move into it
$ mkdir {{app-env-id}} && cd {{app-env-id}}

# Get the plainkit
$ wget https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit/archive/main.zip

# Unzip the plainkit
$ unzip main.zip

# Move all contents from the folder one level up
$ mv plainkit-main/* .

# Remove artifacts
$ rm -rf main.zip plainkit-main
```
