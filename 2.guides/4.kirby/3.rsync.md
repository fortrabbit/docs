## Get ready

Our recommendation is to use a [combination of Git and rsync](/2.guides/4.kirby/2.git-and-rsync.md) where code is deployed via Git and the content folder is synced down (and up) by rsync. But you can also deploy the whole project using rsync as well. Upload code changes and download content changes. It is further recommended to have a [local development environment](/3.dev/19.how-to/1.local-development.md) with Kirby CMS running.

## Usage

```shell
# DOWN: from remote to local
$ rsync -av {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app:~/ ./

# UP: from local to remote
$ rsync -av ./ {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app:~/
```

See the [rsync article](/3.dev/rsync.md) for more details on rsync.

## The vendor folder

When syncing the whole project folder, the vendor folder will be synced along. In most cases this works surprisingly well. Keep in mind that the local development environment and the software versions of the local PHP environment and the fortrabbit remote should roughly match for that to work. It's possible to run `composer install` with the fortrabbit environment. A better alternative is to use Git deployment and automate composer with [build commands](/3.dev/2.deployment/3.build-commands.md).
