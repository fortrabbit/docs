## Get ready

- Have a [local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md) running.
- Have [Kirby installed locally](/2.guides/4.kirby/01.install.md).
- Have an account with fortrabbit.
- Have an app created at fortrabbit, ideally using the Kirby preset.

## Deployment

```shell
# UP: from local to remote (syncs to the app root)
$ rsync -av ./ {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app:

# DOWN: from remote to local (syncs from the app root)
$ rsync -av {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app: ./
```

See the [rsync article](/3.dev/20.how-to/rsync.md) for more details.

## The vendor folder

When syncing the project root, the vendor folder is included. In most cases this works surprisingly well. Keep in mind that your local PHP version should roughly match the fortrabbit remote for that to work. It's possible to run `composer install` on the fortrabbit environment. A better alternative is to use Git deployment and automate composer with [build commands](/1.platform/05.deployment/03.build-commands.md) using [git and rsync workflow](/2.guides/4.kirby/03.git-and-rsync.md).
