## Get ready

1. Have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) running
2. Local [Laravel installation](/2.guides/2.laravel/01.install.md)
3. Know about [deployment features](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md)
4. Install the [fortrabbit GitHub app](/1.platform/05.deployment/2.github-app.md) with your GitHub account
5. Completed [Laravel setup steps](/2.guides/2.laravel/02.setup.md)

## Recommended Laravel build steps

Laravel is versatile. It can act as a backend to exchange with a frontend or it can be used as a monolith. It might be extended with additional software. Therefore [deployment build step pipeline](/1.platform/05.deployment/3.build-commands.md) options differ. Configure the build steps in the fortrabbit dashboard. These are commonly used:

### Composer build step

In almost all cases you will want to run Composer during deployment for Laravel based applications, see also [Composer on fortrabbit](/3.dev/15.learn/02.composer.md).

```shell
composer install
```

### NPM build step

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is the default asset bundler for Laravel. For more details on using Vite, see [Laravel's docs](https://laravel.com/docs/vite).

```shell
npm run build
```

This will compile the assets and place them in a `build` folder in the `public` directory. This folder is by default excluded from the repo in `.gitignore`.

### Migration build step

If you are using a database, you likely will want to run database migrations after you have deployed. We advice to ad this to run:

```shell
php artisan migrate --force
```

## Mostly done

Now you should have setup an automatic deployment pipeline that will listen to changes on your GitHub repo branch and deploy these automatically, running the configured build steps.

## Storage folders

::CallOut{alert}
During Alpha/Beta you may need to create folders manually.
::

```bash
// logged in by SSH
$ mkdir -p storage/framework/{sessions,views,cache}
```

## Database syncing

Laravel applications with databases may require content syncing from your local development to the environment or the other way around. Please see [MySQl import/export guides](/3.dev/08.mysql/02.export-import/07.export-import-intro.md).

## Additional workflows

The fortrabbit platform is not limited to GitHub deployment. Your application might has runtime data such as uploaded assets that require syncing. Have a look at our [deployment features in 'Code VS Content'](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md#code-vs-content) for options and concepts.
