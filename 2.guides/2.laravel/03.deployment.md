## Get ready

1. Have a [local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md) running
2. Local [Laravel installation](/2.guides/2.laravel/01.install.md)
3. Know about [deployment features](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md)
4. Install the [fortrabbit GitHub app](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md) with your GitHub account
5. Completed [Laravel setup steps](/2.guides/2.laravel/02.setup.md)

## Initialize Git and add GitHub

Here's an example using Git and [GitHub CLI](/4.integrations/07.git-clients/02.gh-cli.md) to set up a local repository and connect it to GitHub:

```shell
# Setup local git repo
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'Init'

# GitHub CLI to create/connect remote Git repo
$ gh repo new
# Follow the steps
# Push an existing local repository to github.com
# Add as remote and assign current branch as 'origin'
```

At the end, the Git repo at GitHub is created and content already pushed. From now on you only need to run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to send code changes to GitHub.

See the [git deployment intro](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) for more details on how to connect a local repo to a GitHub remote and enable automatic deployment using the [fortrabbit GitHub App](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md).

## Connect your GitHub repo with fortrabbit

If you already created an app on fortrabbit, connect the repository through the app settings. If not, create a new app on fortrabbit and set up the deployment:

:BlockLink{title="Create a new (free trial) app" path="/new/app"}

Choose Laravel as the software preset. Use Git deployment and select the Git repository you created previously.
