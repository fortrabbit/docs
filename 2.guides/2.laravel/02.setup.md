## Get ready

- [Local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) up and running.
- [Laravel installed locally](/2.guides/2.laravel/01.install.md) best with attached Git repo.
- Install the [fortrabbit GitHub App](/3.dev/03.deployment/02.github-app.md) for automatic deployments.

## Create an app at fortrabbit

Create a new app in the fortrabbit dashboard. The wizard will guide you through the steps. You can connect the repo from GitHub.

## Software template

If Laravel is detected or you have chosen it in the software list, the Laravel [software template](/1.platform/02.concepts/05.software-templates.md) will be applied. This will pre-configure common ENV vars, build and post-deploy commands and set the root path to `public`.

## MySQL configuration

Not all Laravel projects require a database connection. Some do. Just keep `config/database.php` as it is when you have chosen Laravel with the software template. The all CAPITAL configs in the `config/database.php` file will be replaced by the contents of the environment variables. For your local development setup you can populate the `.env` file with your local database credentials. See the [ENV var topic](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md) as well.

This will enable the app environment to connect to the database.
