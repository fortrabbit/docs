## Get ready

Have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) up and running.

## Install Laravel on your local machine

**Recommended**: Use the detailed [official Laravel install guide](https://laravel.com/docs/installation) as your guideline to install Laravel on your local machine first. Here is the gist:

```shell
# Install the Laravel installer
composer global require laravel/installer

# Create a Laravel project
laravel new {project_folder_name}
```

In some cases Laravel is the framework for the actual software that runs on top - like with [Statamic](/2.guides/5.statamic/1.setup.md) or [October CMS](/2.guides/7.more/6.october-cms.md).

## Install Laravel on the server

Another option is to install Laravel directly on the environment like so:

1. Login to an environment by [SSH](/3.dev/01.code-access/3.ssh.md)
2. Run the above steps to install a Laravel project
3. Move all files in `{project_folder_name}` one level up again

We believe it's better to start with a local development environment first. A local first approach is easier for Git deployments too.

## Add your magic

Installing a plain Laravel will not do much. Now add your templates, design and content to make it shine. You probably don't need hosting right away. Most development can happen locally. Start thinking about deployment, once it's ready.

## Setup GitHub

**Optional but recommended**: To enable git deployments later on, init git and add GitHub as remote repo, either as a public or private.
