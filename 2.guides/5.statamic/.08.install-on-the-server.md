## Get ready

1. Ignore advice to [install and develop Statamic locally](/2.guides/5.statamic/01.install.md).
2. Ignore advice to [deploy Statamic with Git + rsync](/2.guides/5.statamic/03.deploy-git-rsync.md).

Seriously. Please don't install Statamic or any software directly on the server. Better have a local development environment and proper deployment strategies. It's much faster and way more secure in the long run.

## Install Statamic on the server

1. Login to an environment by [SSH](/1.platform/04.code-access/03.ssh.md)
2. Run the [steps to install](/2.guides/5.statamic/01.install.md#install-statamic-locally) a Statamic project
3. Move all files in `{project_folder_name}` one level up again
