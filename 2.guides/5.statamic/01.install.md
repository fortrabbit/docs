## Get ready

Have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) with PHP and a web server ready.

## Install Statamic locally

**Recommended approach**: Before you deploy anything to fortrabbit, get your Statamic project running on your local computer. Please see the [official Statamic install guide](https://statamic.dev/installing/local) for up-to-date instructions. It boils down to something like this:

```shell
# Install the Statamic CLI
composer global require statamic/cli

# Create a new Statamic project
statamic new {project_folder_name}
```

It would also be good to already have your first admin user set up.

## Install Statamic on the server

Another option is to install Statamic directly on the environment like so:

1. Login to an environment by [SSH](/3.dev/01.code-access/3.ssh.md)
2. Run the above steps to install a Statamic project
3. Move all files in `{project_folder_name}` one level up again

We believe it's easier and more straight forward to start with a local development environment first. A local first approach is easier for Git + rsync deployments too.

## Setup GitHub

**Optional**: To enable git deployments later on, init git and add GitHub as remote repo - either as a public or private.
