## Get ready

Have a [local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md) with PHP and a web server ready.

## Install Statamic locally

Before you deploy anything, get Statamic running on your local computer. Please see the [official Statamic install guide](https://statamic.dev/getting-started/installing/local) for up-to-date instructions. It boils down to something like this:

```shell
# Install the Statamic CLI
composer global require statamic/cli

# Create a new Statamic project
statamic new {project_folder_name}
```

It would also be good to already have your first admin user set up. Now add your templates, design and content to make it shine.
