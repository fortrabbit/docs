We assume you've already created an [app](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md) and chose WordPress in the [software template](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md). In the following, you will install WordPress directly on the environment. We do not recommend to use [git deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) since, WordPress is not ready for it yet.

## Install WordPress

Open your terminal app of choice, login to the environment by SSH, directly download WordPress like so:

```shell
# 1. Login to your environment via SSH
$ ssh {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app

# Once you are logged in:

# 2. Download latest WordPress
$ wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

# 3. Unpack wordpress
$ tar zxf latest.tar.gz

# 4. Move unpackged files to top level
$ mv wordpress/* .

# 5. Remove the downloaded container
$ rm -r wordpress latest.tar.gz
```

## Run the installer

Once the upload is finished:

:BlockLink{title="Visit test domain" path="https://{{app-env-id}}.frbit.app" property="none"}

Commence with the guided web installation to finish the setup. See the dashboard to look up your database credentials. The installer will also ask you for your WordPress site's Site title, User name, Password, Your email and so on. After the guided web setup is done, you will be automatically redirected to the WordPress admin login form. Use the previously chosen credentials to login.

## Installing themes & plugins

These are pretty standard operations. You can download and update themes directly from the WordPress admin. Or you can create your own, test them locally, then upload them to your remote themes folder. The same applies to plugins.
