The good news is that WordPress has automatic background updates and they are enabled by default. Please check the article from the official WordPress codex on how to [configure automatic background updates](https://wordpress.org/support/article/configuring-automatic-background-updates) and take care that your WordPress core, plugins and even themes are always [up-to-date](#updating-wordpress).

## Protect against bots

WordPress often gets targeted by bots, trying to access `wp-login.php` and `xmlrpc.php`. Blocking access to these files will increase stability and security.

## Sending e-mails

You cannot use [sendmail](/1.platform/02.concepts/04.limits.md#mailing) on fortrabbit but you can use a SMTP plugin like [WP SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smtp) or [MAIL SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp) to enable SMTP support for the `wp_mail()` function.

## Resetting your password for wp-admin

Some users might be too lazy to configure the mail delivery for WordPress via SMTP (see above). Now imagine they also forget the password for `wp-admin`. Without email, the forgot password function from WordPress will not work. The user can still set a new password in the database. Like so:

1. Connect to the remote MySQL database from local
2. Browse the MySQL tables to find the right admin user
3. Choose a safe password
4. Convert that password to a MD5 hash
5. Update the table with the new password
6. Go back to wp-admin and login using the new password

## Running WordPress in a sub folder

There are two reasons to install WordPress in a sub directory instead of in `htdocs`:

1. WordPress is just the blog-part of the website: `mydomain.com/blog`
2. You want to run multiple WordPress sites in one app environment. Please don't.

You can achieve the first option by putting WordPress in a folder and by changing the "Site Address URL" parameter (see above). Also see the official WordPress codex on how to [give WordPress it's own directory](https://wordpress.org/support/article/giving-wordpress-its-own-directory).
