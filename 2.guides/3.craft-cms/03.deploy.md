## Get ready

- [Installed Craft CMS locally](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md).
- [Completed setup](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/02.setup.md).

The fortrabbit platform is not limited to GitHub deployment. See [code access](/1.platform/04.code-access/01.intro.md) for available options.

```bash
git push
```

Your application might has runtime data such as uploaded assets that require syncing. Have a look at our [deployment features 'Code VS Content'](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md#code-vs-content) for options and concepts.

## Build commands

Craft CMS is a pretty standardized application. In most cases the [build commands](/1.platform/05.deployment/03.build-commands.md) are pre-configured through stack detection (scanning the repo).

```shell
composer install # Always
npm run prod # If detected
```

### Post deploy commands

In most cases it's useful to run database migrations after deployment to apply changes from project config and migrate all changes. These post deploy commands are pre-configured by [software template](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md):

```shell
php craft project-config/apply
php craft migrate/all
```

## Assets management

Don't put the assets (uploads) in Git. Git is not made for binary files and it only works as a once way street. Deploy the Craft `assets` folder separately: [Deploy Craft CMS assets with rsync](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/10.assets.md)
