## Install and deploy run down

1. [Install Craft CMS locally](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md)
2. [Setup an app at fortrabbit](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/02.setup.md)
3. **Deploy code via Git** _← you are here_
4. [Database syncing](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/04.database.md)
5. [Assets syncing](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/05.assets.md)

## Git deployment

You are mostly set when you have followed our Craft CMS guides so far. Your local Craft CMS project is connected with a Git repo at GitHub and you have created an app and connected it to your GitHub repo.

You can now trigger a code deployment by issuing `git push` or clicking the deploy button with the dashboard. This will update the GitHub repo and deploy the latest commit to fortrabbit. See the [Git deployment intro](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) on how this works. The fortrabbit platform is not limited to [GitHub based deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md). See [code access](/1.platform/04.code-access/01.intro.md) for available options.

## Deployment configuration

**Likely nothing to do here.** Craft CMS is a pretty standardized application. In most cases the [build commands](/1.platform/05.deployment/03.build-commands.md) are pre-configured through [stack detection](/1.platform/03.concepts/03.stack-detector.md) (scanning the repo) or [software template](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md).

### Deployment strategy

Craft CMS projects are set to [blend deployment strategy](/1.platform/05.deployment/08.strategy.md#blend-strategy) with [replace patterns](/1.platform/05.deployment/15.replace-patterns.md) for all project config YML files in the config folder by default. This is because the [Craft asset volumes](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/05.assets.md) can be placed anywhere in the file structure.

Consider using the [replace strategy](/1.platform/05.deployment/08.strategy.md#replace-strategy) with [exclude patterns](/1.platform/05.deployment/10.exclude-patterns.md) for each asset volume. It works either way.

### Build commands

This setting is most likely pre-configured.

```shell
composer install # Always
npm run prod # If detected
```

### Post deploy commands

This setting is most likely pre-configured. In most cases it's useful to run database migrations after deployment to apply changes from project config and migrate all changes.

```shell
php craft project-config/apply
php craft migrate/all
```
