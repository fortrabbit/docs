## Get ready

- Have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) up and running.
- Have installed [Craft CMS locally](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md).
- Installed the [fortrabbit GitHub App](/3.dev/03.deployment/02.github-app.md) for [automatic deployments](/3.dev/03.deployment/01.intro.md).

## Create an app at fortrabbit

Create a new app in the fortrabbit dashboard. The wizard will guide you through the steps. You can connect the repo from GitHub.

## Configuration

If Craft CMS is detected or you have chosen it in the software list, the Craft CMS [software template](/1.platform/02.concepts/05.software-templates.md) will be applied. This will pre-configure common [ENV vars](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md), build commands, post deploy commands and set the root path to `web`.
