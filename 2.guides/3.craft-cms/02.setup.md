## Install and deploy run down

1. [Install Craft CMS locally](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md)
2. **Setup an app at fortrabbit** _← you are here_
3. [Deploy code via Git](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/03.deployment.md)
4. [Database syncing](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/04.database.md)
5. [Assets syncing](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/05.assets.md)

## Install the fortrabbit GitHub App (recommended)

To enable [automatic git deployments](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) the [fortrabbit GitHub App](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md) needs to be installed with your personal account. You can do and verify this with your account settings:

:BlockLink{title="Check GitHub app" path="/you/settings"}

You can also do that later or skip it all together if you don't plan to use automatic git deployment, but SFTP upload.

## Create an app at fortrabbit

Create a new app in the fortrabbit dashboard. The wizard will guide you through the steps.

:BlockLink{title="Create a new app" path="/new/app"}

If you have the GitHub app connected and already a Git repo for your project you can connect the repo now. It will detect the software. If not, choose Craft CMS as software.

## Configuration

If Craft CMS is detected or you have chosen it in the software list, the Craft CMS [software template](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md) will be applied. This will pre-configure common [ENV vars](/3.dev/19.env-vars/01.intro.md), build commands, post deploy commands and set the root path to `web`.
