## Get ready

- Have a [local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md) running. [DDEV](/4.integrations/01.local-development/02.ddev.md) is recommended.
- Use the [official Craft CMS install guide](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/install.html) as your guideline.
- Skip this step when you already have an existing Craft project running locally.

## Run down

This Craft CMS installation guide will walk you through:

1. Install Craft CMS locally <- you are here
2. Setup an app at fortrabbit
3. Configure code deployment via Git
4. Setup database syncing
5. Setup asset syncing

## Choose your install workflow

The way you will install Craft will set the course on how you will deploy Craft CMS here on fortrabbit:

### A - Create with Composer (recommended)

This is the recommended - more sophisticated - way. You will use [Git](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) and [Composer](/3.dev/15.learn/02.composer.md) in the Terminal. Run this command **on you local machine** to create a Craft CMS project to get started:

```shell
composer create-project craftcms/craft my-project
```

See an error? Check your [local development](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md). Later on you can deploy Craft with Git on fortrabbit.

### B - Download zip file

Are you more "designer" and less "developer"? Just download Craft directly from the Craft website: [craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip](https://craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip). Unpack that zip file to get to the actual project files.

## Install Craft CMS locally

Configure it to work on your local machine now. You have two options to install Craft:

### A - Terminal setup (recommended)

```shell [content/index.md]
# 1. go into your local Craft folder
$ cd my-project

# 2. run the terminal installer
$ ./craft setup
```

This will ask you some questions, the defaults will work mostly, you can change these settings later.

### B - Browser setup

You can also run the installer in the browser by visiting this address: `http://{{host}}/index.php?p=admin/install` in your browser. Substitute `{{host}}` with the [host name of your local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md).

## Add your magic

Installing a plain Craft CMS will not do much. Now add your templates, database structure, design, plugins and content to make it shine. We recommend to do this work mostly in your local development environment.

## Choose a deployment workflow


### A - Git deployment with database and asset syncing (recommended)

fortrabbit offers a 

To enable git deployments later on, init git and add GitHub as remote repo - either as a public or private.

[Deployment intro](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md)
- [Git intro](/3.dev/15.learn/git-intro.md)

### B - SFTP

Later on you can upload Craft with [SFTP](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md).
