## Get ready

Make sure to have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) up and running. Use the detailed [official Craft install guide](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/installation.html) as your guideline to install Craft on your local machine first. Skip this step when you already have an existing Craft project running locally.

## Choose your Craft install workflow

The way you will install Craft will set the course on how you will deploy Craft CMS here on fortrabbit:

### 1a. Download Craft with Composer

This is the recommended - more sophisticated - way. You will use [Git](/3.dev/03.deployment/01.intro.md) and [Composer](/3.dev/15.learn/02.composer.md) in the Terminal. Run this command **on you local machine** to create a Craft CMS project to get started:

```shell
composer create-project craftcms/craft {{app-env-id}}
```

See an error? Check your [local development](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md). Later on you can deploy Craft with Git on fortrabbit.

### 1b. Download the Craft zip file

Are you more "designer" and less "developer"? SFTP also works here. Just download Craft directly from the Craft website: [craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip](https://craftcms.com/latest-v3.zip). Unpack that zip file to get to the actual project files. Later on you can upload Craft with [SFTP](/3.dev/01.code-access/4.sftp.md).

## Install Craft CMS locally

Configure it to work on your local machine now. You have two options to install Craft:

### 2a. Terminal setup

```shell [content/index.md]
# 1. go into your local Craft folder
$ cd {{app-env-id}}

# 2. run the terminal installer
$ ./craft setup
```

This will ask you some questions, the defaults will work mostly, you can change these settings later.

### 2b. Browser setup

You can also run the installer in the browser by visiting this address: `http://{{host}}/index.php?p=admin/install` in your browser. Substitute `{{host}}` with the [host name of your local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md).

## Add your magic

Installing a plain Craft CMS will not do much. Now add your templates, design and content to make it shine.

## Setup GitHub

**Optional**: To enable git deployments later on, init git and add GitHub as remote repo - either as a public or private.
