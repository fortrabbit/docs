## Install and deploy run down

1. [Install Craft CMS locally](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md)
2. [Setup an app at fortrabbit](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/02.setup.md)
3. [Deploy code via Git](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/03.deployment.md)
4. **Database syncing** _← you are here_
5. [Assets syncing](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/05.assets.md)

## Database configuration setup

In most cases, the Craft CMS installation on fortrabbit can already connect to the remote [MySQL database](/1.platform/09.components/02.mysql.md) through pre-populated [environment variables](/1.platform/06.settings/01.env-vars.md).

But when initially installing Craft CMS on your fortrabbit environment, after [Git deployment](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/03.deployment.md) or [SFTP upload](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md) your database is still missing. In most cases you want to import your local database now, to have database content and structure up.

Visit the [MySQL import/export guides](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/07.intro.md) to learn how to sync the database up and down using different techniques.

### Database up

1. Export the local database
2. Upload the the dumped `.sql` file
3. Import the database dump into the app environment database

- [Database up via terminal](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/08.database-up-terminal.md)
- [Database up via MySQL GUI](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/10.database-up-gui.md)

### Database down

In later live cycle stages of your project you more often likely would like to download the database.

1. Export the remote database
2. Download the dumped `.sql` file
3. Import the database in your local development

- [Database down via terminal](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/09.database-down-terminal.md)
- [Database down via MySQL GUI](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/11.database-down-gui.md)
