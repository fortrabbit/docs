## Get ready

- [Installed Craft CMS locally](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md).
- [Completed setup](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/02.setup.md).
- [Deployed code](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/03.deploy.md).

## Prerequisite

You can deploy code with a `git push` (or SFTP) and sync assets with rsync. Database contents also need to be synced up and down (usually the later).

This is a typical chicken egg problem. In most cases, when settings things up you have a database locally with structure and contents.

### Database up run down

1. Export the local database
2. Upload the the dumped .sql file
3. Import the database dump into the app environment database

Visit the [MySQL import/export guides](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/07.intro.md) to learn how to sync the database up and down using different techniques. It is crucial to import the database to the remote with initial setup.

### Database down run down

1. Export the remote database
2. Download the dumped .sql file
3. Import the database in your local development
