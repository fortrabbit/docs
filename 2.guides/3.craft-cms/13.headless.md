## Intro

With Craft CMS headless mode you have a Craft CMS installation that consists only of the backend without any server-side Twig templates. In addition you create another application, usually with a JavaScript framework (Next, Nuxt, React, Vue …) that will fetch content using the built-in GraphQL API and render it on the client-side in the browser.

## Headers

By default HTTP responses with content type `text/html`, `text/css` and `text/javascript` are gzipped. When you use Craft in headless mode as a GraphQL or REST API, the content type is application/json. In the article about [GZIP compression](/3.dev/21.htaccess/04.gzip.md) you learn how to enable it for other content types.
