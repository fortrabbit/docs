For general information on how to add domains to your fortrabbit App, please see our [domains article](/3.dev/dns-external-domains.md). For Craft CMS be sure to have set your domain's root path to the `/web` folder.

When installing Craft locally, it will ask you which domain you want to use. This local domain differs form the one you want to use in production. That's why it is stored in the `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` ENV var. The installer creates this ENV var in the .env file. In your fortrabbit production environment you may need to set `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` using the ENV var settings of your App.

Craft CMS uses `@web` alias internally when it deals with HTTP requests. Unless you define it, Craft will try to figure it out based on HTTP headers - which is not always possible. It's good practice to define it explicitly using `PRIMARY_SITE_URL` ENV var.

```php
return [
  // Recommended aliases in config/general.php
  'aliases' => [
    '@web' => \craft\helpers\App::env('PRIMARY_SITE_URL') ?: '/',
    '@webroot' => dirname(__DIR__) . '/web'
  ],
];
```

You can also add multiple domains. From the fortrabbit side, just point them to the App's root path, configure routing and display of contents within Craft CMS and/or use additional [htaccess rules](/3.dev/htaccess).

## Multi site domain settings

For multi-site setups, you may need to hard-code the domains for each environment. Here is an example of that:

```php
return [
  // fortrabbit (multi site)
  'production' => [
    'siteUrl' => [
      'en' => '//www.site.com',
      'nl' => '//www.site.nl',
    ],
  ],
  // local (multi site)
  'dev' => [
    'siteUrl' => [
      'en' => '//en.site.dev',
      'nl' => '//nl.site.dev',
    ],
  ],
];
```
