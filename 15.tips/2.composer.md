## Get ready

It's recommended that you have a [local development environment](/15.tips/1.local-development.md) running including Composer and that you are making use of it already. Have a good understanding of [deployment in general](/6.deployment/1.intro.md) and on fortrabbit.

## Composer as part of deployment

We recommend to run `composer install` as part of the build pipeline. When you deploy code with Git and Composer is defined as a [build step](/6.deployment/4.build-steps.md), it will run automatically with each deployment. New and updated dependencies will be synced into the web space.

## Composer and Git

The `vendor` folder should NOT be in Git: Make sure that folder is included in your `.gitignore` file. This directory is created by Composer within your project locally and contains all the packages you are using locally. Make sure that both the `composer.lock` file and the `composer.json` file are present and part of Git.

## Alternative locations

Your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files need to be stored in the root folder of your application.

## Private repositories in Composer

You need to add the private repositories into your `composer.json` file? Read on [here](/15.tips/composer-private-repos.md).

## Composer from SSH

While we highly recommend leveraging Composer via the Git deployment (see above), you can also execute Composer when logged in via [SSH](/7.code-access/3.ssh.md). Please note that this should only be done in certain edge cases.

```shell
ssh {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com
composer install
```

This way Composer will be executed within the web delivery environment, which is not optimized for such tasks. **Don't use `composer update` as this might cause Composer to hit the App's memory limits.** The most common Composer issue is, when users are running into memory problems when trying to execute composer while logged in via SSH here. The general answer on that is: Please don't. Use Composer together with Git deployment as described above.
