The [backup component](/9.components/5.backups.md) is available in different plans. Larger ones include more backups. Backup retention determines how long backups are kept. This concept is crucial for ensuring data availability, compliance, and efficient storage management.

Depending on the plan chosen, multiple backups of the same type might be included. If the plan includes three monthly backups, then monthly backups are retained for three months.

## Daily backups

- kept for a short period
- created daily at randomized times

## Weekly backups

- retained for a longer period
- created Sundays

## Monthly backups

- kept for an extended period
- created by the start of the month
