In your `.htaccess` file you can add this line:

```raw
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000"
</IfModule>
```

This will make your browser remember to always use the secured version of your website. It makes use of the "[HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)" policy and improves security by eliminating the risks of man-in-the-middle TLS-protocol-downgrade attacks. Be careful: setting this header will tell the browser never (or that is: until max-age) to use `http://` again. So if you later on decide to serve (parts of) your site using no encryption, all those clients (browsers) which saw the header will not comply and keep using `https://`.
