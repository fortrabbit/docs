## Tip: Comment your .htaccess file

Apache directives with regular expressions tend to look gibberish. Make sure to comment what you have been doing there so that "the later you" can understand what's going on.

## Block all common WordPress files

```apache [.htaccess]
<Location ~ "(wp-login\.php|wp-comments-post\.php)$">
  Order allow,deny
  Deny from all
</Location>
```

### Limit WP Admin to an IP if possible

```apache [.htaccess]
<Files wp-login.php>
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
  Allow from <YOUR IP>
</Files>
```

## Block specific file extensions

```apache [.htaccess]
# Archives you probably don't want to expose
<FilesMatch "\.(bz2|gz|zip)$">
   Order allow,deny
   Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
```

## Allow access only for you

You may want to prevent accessing your website for anyone except your company. If your company has a fixed IP, you can use `.htaccess` to only allow traffic from that IP or range of IPs.

```apache [.htaccess]
### 1st deny all

ErrorDocument 403 "Not Allowed"
Deny from all

### 2nd Allow your IPs 

Allow from 11.11.11.11
Allow from 12.12.12.12
```

An alternative to this is to use a password check with [HTTP Auth article](/14.tips/htaccess/3.http-auth.md).

## Custom error pages

You can define custom pages to make your error pages look more cool like so:

```apache
ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
```

This has to be a publicly accessible URL. You can do this with 4XX and 5XX errors. When using a framework or CMS likely the router will catch such errors and use PHP logic to resolve it, still some 5XX errors might appear before the program can execute the router.
