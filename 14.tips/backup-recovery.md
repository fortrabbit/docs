lead: How to use the files downloaded from the backup component to actually restore a website

There are two types of backups: MySQL and web storage. Here is how you recover from either:

### Recover MySQL

The MySQL backup file is a regular MySQL dump, generated by the `mysqldump` tool. You can recover from it the same way you would (re-)import MySQL data into your database. Please read on [MySQL export/import](../11.concepts/9.mysql/3.export-import.md).

### Recover web storage

	Web storage backups are stored in an uncompressed `.tar` archive file. How to recover your web storage data, depends on what you want to recover: Just a single file, a couple of files or everything?

**Recover a single file or a couple of files**: Just download the web storage backup file, unpack it locally, copy the files you want to recover manually back to your App.

**Recover everything**: After downloading and unpacking the web storage `.tar` archive locally, you need to remove all files from your current App, then upload the previously unpacked archive again.

## Backup excludes

Some run-time and cache files, like a `storage` folder, are excluded from the file backups to save some space within the backups. For the same reason `*.mysql` files are excluded - we already provide MySQL backups without affecting performance while creating. Whole exclude list:

```raw
# Craft 3 and 4
storage/backups
storage/logs
storage/runtime
web/cpresources

# Laravel
storage/framework
storage/logs

# Misc
.git
.idea
*.sql
```
