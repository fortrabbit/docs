## Authentication in teams

You manage your code access with your user account on fortrabbit. This way you always have up-to-date code access on each App you own and collaborate on. It also makes managing the team easy — add/remove collaborators and code access is handled "automagically". Please mind that your team members might have a different access method and that your settings might not work for them.
