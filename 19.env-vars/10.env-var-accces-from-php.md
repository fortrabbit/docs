## ENV vars in frameworks and CMS

Frameworks and content management systems will usually parse and use ENV vars automatically.

## ANV vars access from raw PHP

You can access your ENV vars from PHP either using the global variable `$_SERVER` or the function `getenv()`:

```php
echo $_SERVER["MY_ENV_VAR"];
# or
echo getenv("MY_ENV_VAR");
```
