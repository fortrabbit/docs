## ENV vars access from PHP

The [getenv() PHP function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.php) accepts the key of an environment variable and returns it's value.

```php
echo getenv("MY_ENV_VAR");
```

Access ENV vars from PHP either using the global variable `$_SERVER`:

```php
echo $_SERVER["MY_ENV_VAR"];
```

## ENV vars in frameworks and CMS

Frameworks and content management systems will usually parse and use ENV vars automatically. Usually [.env files](/19.env-vars/10.dotenv-file.md) are supported for local development. A config file to grab may `$dbHost = env('DB_HOST');`.

- **Laravel**: Use the `env()` helper function
- **Craft CMS**: `getenv()` in `config/general.php`
- **WordPress**: `getenv()` to access environment variables in `wp-config.php`
