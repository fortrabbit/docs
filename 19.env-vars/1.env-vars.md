## Problem

You most likely run at least two environments of your app: A [local one for development](/15.tips/local-development.md) and one here on fortrabbit for production. Both instances probably have access to a database. Your local MySQL has of course different credentials than the remote one. Your `config.php` file is under Git version control. So how to deal with different environment-specific configurations, from database credentials to API keys? Also, how to work in a team when everyone has it's own local settings? How to separate code from configuration, so that the code is portable and no secrets are shared?

## Solution

Everything specific to the environment should be stored in environment variables or short 'ENV vars'. An ENV var is a key value pair, like so: `MY_SQL_PASS:sCRAmblEDegGGs`. The concept of ENV vars is used by different software systems, like Apache, Node.js, PHP. You can access ENV vars from PHP. And it is a commonly wide spread best practice to do that.
