## 1. Tell fortrabbit about your domain

1. Click New > "Add a new domain" and follow the steps
2. Choose a domain name and an environment
3. Keep the overview tab open to copy the desired DNS settings

:DashboardLink{title="Add a new domain" path="/new/domain"}

## 2. Point the domain to fortrabbit

Use the provided DNS information from the fortrabbit dashboard to change the domain routing with your domain provider.

- For sub domains like www, use the CNAME record
- Apex domains get an A record for [forwarding](/13.dns/2.domain-forwarding.md)
- Leave any other records untouched, especially MX
- Remove any AAAA records (IPV6)

Save the settings with your domain provider and wait a while. The while depends on the TTL settings of the DNS records, or usually up to 6h.

## Domain registrar instructions

Your domain host is usually the place where you purchased your domain name, such as GoDaddy, Enom, or Name.com. See [general domain provider integration](/14.integrations/10.domain-providers.md) as well.

Below are links to instructions for specific domain providers. These settings are typically configured through the provider's control panel.
