- It uses '301 Moved Permanently' headers
- It works for `https`
- It also works for deep links like `https://your-domain.com/page`
- It works for `www.` no other subdomains

## How to use

When adding a www domain to the dashboard you will be provided a CNAME record (host name) for the www prefix and an A record (IP address) for the Apex domain. The IP address is the forwarding service. You will add both records with your [domain provider](/13.dns/10.domain-providers.md).

## Recommendations

- Use `www.domain.tld` instead of just `domain.tld` in all links
- Send your external traffic (e.g. advertisement clicks) to the `www.` domain
- Configure your uptime checks with a URL to the the `www.` domain

## Alternatives

You don't have to use the fortrabbit free domain forwarding service, other options:

- [ALIAS / ANAME routing](/15.tips/aname-alias-records.md)
- Forwarding, using your domain provider
