## Get ready

Make sure to have a [local development environment](/11.dev-tips/2.local-development.md) up and running. Use the detailed [official Craft install guide](https://docs.craftcms.com/v4/installation.html) as your guideline to install Craft on your local machine first. You can safely skip this step when you already have an existing Craft project running locally.
