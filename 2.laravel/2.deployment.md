## Get ready

Make sure to have followed our recommended [setup steps for Laravel](/2.laravel/1.setup.md).

## Choose your workflow

### Setup for an existing code base

When moving from another host to fortrabbit, please also read our [migration guide](/migrating).

### MySQL configuration

If you have chosen Laravel in the [Software Preset](/12.platform/software-presets.md) when creating your App, we will automatically populate the "right" environment variables for the MySQL connection. So **you don't need to set anything**! Just keep `config/database.php` as it is.

The all CAPITAL configs in the `config/database.php` file will be replaced by the contents of the environment variables. For your local development setup you can populate the `.env` file with your local database credentials. See our [ENV var article](/env-vars) as well.
