lead: Use the new platform now for new projects. Early adaptors can also migrate their apps. We will migrate remaining apps later. In most cases, no action will be required.

## Accounts

All existing accounts have been copied over to the new platform with converted collaboration structure. You can login to both platforms using your existing e-mail and password combination, see [platform access](/1.new/1.access.md). Apps have not been copied yet. You can create new apps on the new platform however.

## Self-service migration

Early adaptors are welcome to already migrate their apps to the new platform. Recommended workflow overview using Git deployment:

1. Create a new app with the new platform
2. Add the fortrabbit GitHub app to your GitHub account
3. Create or map an existing repo at GitHub
4. Connect your local code base to the repo at GitHub
5. Push to deploy (again)
6. If required: Sync the database to the new app
7. If required: Sync the contents to the new app
8. Test functionality
9. Point your domain to the new DNS entries

## fortrabbit migration

After a couple of months we will migrate existing client apps from the old platform to the new platform. In most cases this will not require any interaction, but a maintenance with some downtime. We will inform you ahead.
