## New platform

The new platform version is now live and open for everyone to use. Enjoy a completely redesigned fortrabbit experience yourself now. It will feel new, yet familiar. Check the [changes](/1.new/3.changes.md) on what to expect.

## Legacy platform

The legacy platform is also still open and fully functional and will receive full support until we will finally will have moved over apps to the new platform. There is no rush and we aim to make that as seamless as possible, see our [migration plan](/1.new/2.migration.md) for details and timing.
