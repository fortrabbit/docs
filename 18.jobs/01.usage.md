## Creating jobs

After booking the [jobs component](/9.components/7.jobs.md) a new settings page will become available with the environment in the dashboard. Here you can add, remove, start, stop and edit jobs.

- **Status**: active/disabled
- **Job name**: A unique name, identifier
- **Command**: PHP command to run
- **Job type**: Cron or worker
- **Exit signal**: Graceful shutdown - default is usually fine
- **Exit timeout**: Time to forceful kill when graceful shutdown is not responding

### Cron settings

When choosing the type Cron these additional settings become available:

- **Interval**: How and when the job should run
- **Max runtime**: How long the job is allowed to run

Please also see our [cron primer article](/18.jobs/02.crons.md).

### Command settings

You need to call a command or script via the runtime. To call a PHP task you need to prefix it with `php`. To call a shell script you need to prefix it with `bash`:

- `php artisan queue:listen -v`
- `bash path/to/my-script.sh`
