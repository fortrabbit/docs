## Use cases

The app invite is a flow to share app access between developers who don't know each other so well or don't have to collaborate on a lot of apps.

- A solo developer invites a colleague
- A loosely connected group of developers collaborating per project
- A team works together with another team and shares one app
- A team invites a freelancer to a specific app but not to the whole team
- A client invites a developer

## How it works

This describes the app invite flow from both sides:

### On the inviter side

1. You need to have an [app](/10.objects/1.app.md) already
2. In the dashboard, find the link to invite to an app
3. Select the app you like to invite someone to
4. Enter the email address of your colleague

:DashboardLink{title="invite to app" path="/invite/app"}

### On the invited side

1. Receive an email with an invite link
2. Login to fortrabbit or create a new account for this
3. Accept the invite to gain a [developer connection](/16.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md)

### Consequences

- Invited developers have a [developer connection](/16.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md)
- They have the same access on the app as yourself
- They can change all settings, deploy code and delete the app
- They can also change collaboration of the app
- This does not change billing or access on the payment method of the app
- All interactions are recorded as [events](/10.objects/events.md)

## Alternative team invite

If you plan to collaborate with someone on a regular basis and on more than one app, consider using a [team](/10.objects/4.team.md).
