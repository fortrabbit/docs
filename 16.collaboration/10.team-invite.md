## Use cases

A [team](/10.objects/4.team.md) is group of developers working together on multiple apps. Use this flow to invite a developer to collaborate on multiple (current and future) apps and take part in the team as well. Invite people you know well and trust.

## How it works

This describes the team invite flow from both sides:

### On the inviter side

1. You need to have unlimited access on a [team](/10.objects/4.team.md) already
2. In the dashboard, find the :DashboardLink{title="invite to team" path="/invite/team"} link.
3. Select the team you like to invite someone to
4. Select the role of the invited developer - see [team roles](/16.collaboration/8.team-roles.md)
5. Select the apps they should have access on - see [developer connection](/16.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md)
6. Enter the email address of your colleague

### On the invited side

1. They receive an email with an invite link
2. They login to their fortrabbit account or create a new account for this
3. Then they need to accept the invite

### Consequences

- They will become part of your team with role you selected for them
- Their [team role](/16.collaboration/8.team-roles.md) defines their access level
- All interactions are recorded as [events](/10.objects/events.md)

## Alternative app invite

You can also invite developers or teams to specific apps, see [the app invite flow](/16.collaboration/9.app-invite.md).
