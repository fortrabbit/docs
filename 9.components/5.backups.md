Backups are an optional component available per environment in various plans. They include file and database backups, see [working with backup files](/17.backups/files.md). The encrypted backups are stored off-site and do not count towards your [storage](3.storage.md) usage. Backups can be downloaded from the dashboard, [backup restore](/17.backups/restore.md) is offered too.

The number of backups created depends on your plan size, see [backup retention](/17.backups/retention.md).
