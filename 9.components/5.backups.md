## Booking backups

Backups are an optional component available per environment in different plans. It includes file and mysql backups. There are no performance impacts during backup. The AES-256 encrypted backups are stored off-site. The space does not account for [web storage](3.web-storage.md) usage.

## Scaling backups

The different plan sizes define how many backups will be created. There are no other limits and no autoscaling.

## Configuring backups

Backups are available to download from the dashboard. The web storage backup file is an archive of all the contents of the `htdocs` folder. The MySQL storage files is a plain `sql` file, containing the result of a `mysqldump` of the database.

See the  [backup restore article](/14.tips/backup-recovery.md) on how recover a website from the files included with the backups.
