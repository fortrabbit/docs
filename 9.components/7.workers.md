## Booking & scaling

The Worker is an optional Component that can be booked and scaled from the [Apps](../13.platform/3.environment/app) overview in the [Dashboard](../13.platform/3.environment/dashboard). Workers, like most other Components, are available in various extension states. The scaling is linear and increases two parameters:

* available RAM, we assume a minimum of 128 MB per job
* number of enabled jobs

In addition the CPU resources available scale linear with the amount of memory: a plan with 512 MB memory has access to four times the CPU time as a plan with 128 MB memory.

The memory limit is for all jobs combined. For *Worker L* plans and above, there's also a default soft limit of 1024 MB memory per job to ensure there's enough for all concurrently running jobs - this can be overwritten with `ini_set('memory_limit', xxxxM');` up to your Worker plan limit. The number of configurable jobs is based on the average usage we have seen on our platform. Resources needed for each application can vary largely, depending on what each particular job is doing. It's not unheard of for a single job to consume beyond 512 MB when doing extremely memory intensive tasks. In this case you need to select a plan accordingly.
