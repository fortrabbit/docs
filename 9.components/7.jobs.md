Use jobs to offshore long running and compute intensive tasks and schedule scripts to be run at a certain time. Jobs run in a separated runtime container with access on the file system of the app environment. Jobs are deferred from the front-end web layer to a background process that lives outside the web request/response life-cycle. This way web request can be delivered swiftly even when heavy lifting is happening in the background. Environment variables and settings are kept in sync.
