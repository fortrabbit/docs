## Booking Redis

Redis is implemented as an optional component on fortrabbit with various plans differing the available memory. It can be booked and scaled per [app environment](/12.platform/2.objects/2.app-environment.md).

## Using Redis

Redis is supported by many PHP frameworks and CMS's out of the box, it's popular among [Laravel](/2.laravel/1.setup.md) developers. For specific integrations check out the install guides and find out how to use it with your favorite framework or CMS.

### Session handler

If you don't use a framework, configure `session.save_handler` and `session.save_path` in your php.ini to tell phpredis where to store the sessions. Make sure to do it very early in your application, before accessing session data.

```php
// Read the secrects you've set in the Dashboard
$secrets = json_decode(file_get_contents($_SERVER["APP_SECRETS"]), true);
$host    = $secrets['CUSTOM']['REDIS_HOST'];
$port    = $secrets['CUSTOM']['REDIS_PORT'];
$auth    = $secrets['CUSTOM']['REDIS_PASSWORD'];

// Change the session handler
ini_set('session.save_handler', 'redis');
ini_set("session.save_path", "tcp://{$host}:{$port}?persistent=1&timeout=2&auth={$auth}"); 
```

### Persistent connections

We recommend using persistent connections. Most adapters are configurable with a setting like `persistent: 1`.
