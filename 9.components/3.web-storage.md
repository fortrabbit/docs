## Booking web storage

Web storage is a required component available in different plans. Each app environment needs to have web storage booked.

## Configuring web storage

The web storage is integrated as a persistent file system. You have direct [code access](/7.code-access/index.md) by [SSH](/7.code-access/3.ssh.md) and [SFTP](/7.code-access/4.sftp.md). The web storage contains the deployed code, as well as runtime data, such as uploads and temporary files. See the [directory structure article](/11.concepts/directories.md) to learn about pre-configured folders. The dashboard shows metrics about the web storage size.

## Scaling web storage

The web storage is a passive component. The only property is the actual storage used. It may grow over time as your website writes more files to the disk. Autoscaling is available, see [here on autoscaling](/12.billing/1.pricing.md#autoscaling).

## Backups

Web storage backups are available through the additional [backup component](5.backups.md).
