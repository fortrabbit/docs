## Get ready

Understand that an account at fortrabbit represents a person. [Apps](/10.objects/1.app.md) are owned by [payment methods](/10.objects/9.payment-method.md), which are objects that are controlled by [people](/10.objects/3.person.md). See [billing collaboration](/15.collaboration/3.billing-collaboration.md) for the concepts.

## Use cases

Use the 'invite to payment method' flow to invite someone to access an existing payment method. The invited person can be a non technical business owner (client, see [account types](/15.collaboration/7.account-types.md)) or a tech-savvy developer to connect a team. Use this flow to invite:

- A co-founder of a startup or agency
- Someone from the billing department
- Another team

### Designed for co-ownership

- Clients with a connection to the payment method can receive invoices, change the billing credentials and also
- Developers with a connection to the payment

## How it works

This describes the app invite flow from both sides:

### On the inviter side

1. You need to have a [billing connection](/15.collaboration/5.billing-connection.md) to a [payment method](/10.objects/1.app.md)
2. In the dashboard, find the :DashboardLink{title="invite to payment method" path="/invite/to-payment-method"} link
3. Select the apps you like them to pay
4. Enter the email address of payee

### On the invited side

1. Receive an email with an invite link
2. Login to fortrabbit or create a new account for this
3. Accept the invite and follow the steps to create or choose a new payment method for the apps

### Consequences

- The inviter will loose their [billing connection](/15.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md) to the app
- The inviter will keep the [developer connection](/15.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md)
- The invited account is in power to delete the app or assign other developers
- All interactions are recorded as [events](/10.objects/events.md)

## Alternatives

This flow is specifically made to to transfer payment for apps. You can also invite someone to a [payment method](/15.collaboration/11.payment-method-invite.md) that already exists.
