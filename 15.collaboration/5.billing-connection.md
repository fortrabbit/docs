## Get ready

Billing connections are for developers and clients, see [account types](/15.collaboration/6.account-types.md). With an active billing connection to a payment method, it will be shown to you and you can access settings.

## Direct billing connection

The use of [teams](/10.objects/4.team.md) is optional. You can have your own personal apps that can also be shared. You can also be invited or invite other developers to directly connect to an app you have access on.

## Team billing connections

When creating an app and you have access on teams, you will be asked about the context, which can either be personal or team.
