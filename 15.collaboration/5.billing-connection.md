## Get ready

Billing connections are for developers and clients, see [account types](/15.collaboration/6.account-types.md). With an active billing connection to a [payment method](/10.objects/9.payment-method.md), it will be shown to you and you can access settings.

## Direct billing connection

You can have your own personal payment method that can also be shared. You can also be invited or invite other developers to directly connect to an app you have access on.

## Team billing connections

Team members with unlimited access - see [team roles](/15.collaboration/8.team-roles.md)- have access on all payment methods connected to the team.
