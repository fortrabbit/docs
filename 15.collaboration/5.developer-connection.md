## Get ready

Developer connections are for developers, not for clients, see [account types](/15.collaboration/6.account-types.md). With an active developer connection to an app, it will be shown to you and you can access settings and deploy code.

## Direct developer connection

The use of [teams](/10.objects/4.team.md) is optional. You can have your own personal apps that can also be shared. You can also be invited or invite other developers to directly connect to an app you have access on.

## Team developer connections

When creating an app and you have access on teams, you will be asked about the context, which can either be personal or team.

## App subscription through teams

Not all team members are automatically connected to all apps of the team. Instead you can subscribe to apps that you'd like to be connected to. Unlimited team members can subscribe themselves. Limited team members can request access on team apps. See [team roles](/15.collaboration/7.team-roles.md).

## One developer connection per app

Each developer can only have one active developer connection to an app. While it is possible that an app is connected to different teams and also a developer can be part of different teams, the developer still needs to decide how they want to be connected to the app.
