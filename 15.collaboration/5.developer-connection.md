This applies

With a developer connection to an app, the app will be shown to you with this dashboard and you can access code.

This is a feature when you work wih teams. When creating an app you will be asked about the context.

When working with teams you can choose how you want to be connected to the app. To select a team you need to have unlimited access on the team and the app needs to be connected to the team already.
