lead: Assign developers to be contacted by fortrabbit.
---

Each [app](/10.objects/1.app.md) should have one or more technical contacts associated. There is a dashboard setting with the app to select technical contacts from a list of developers connected with the app. By default, the developer creating the app will be assigned. A technical contact is a [person](/10.objects/3.person.md) - usually the responsible developer with good knowledge of the project and code base.

fortrabbit staff may get in touch with the technical contacts by e-mail to inform about important updates related to specific apps. Examples are:

- Software vulnerabilities
- Important software updates or incompatibilities
- Targeted DDoS attacks
- Excessive resource over-usage
- Suspicious activities
- Website hacked

Pro-actively contacting clients about important issues is done by fortrabbit at a best effort basis. fortrabbit does not guarantee contact coverage for any potential problem. It remains the responsibility of the customer to keep the software up-dated, as well as the list of technical contacts.
