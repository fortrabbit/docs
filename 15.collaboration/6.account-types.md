## Understand individual access

An account on fortrabbit represents a person, not an entity. Your account settings are part of your [personal access](/10.objects/3.person.md) to the fortrabbit system.

## Developer

As a developer you are exposed to all dashboard and platform features. You have technical access to apps and all collaboration features such as teams. Developers can:

- Create and delete teams
- Collaborate in teams
- Create, delete and change apps
- Create, delete and change environments
- Deploy code to environments
- Create, delete and change payment methods
- Change billing for apps

## Client

As a client you have limited access on the dashboard. Most technical aspects are hidden to remove complexity. A client account is also a personal login and should best not be shared. A client can be the client of a freelancing developer or an agency. It can also be the boss or someone from the billing department.

Clients have the power to manage billing aspects and certain parts of collaboration. This includes:

- Add and remove developers and teams to apps
- Delete apps
- Create, delete and change payment methods
- Change billing for apps
