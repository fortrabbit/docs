The illustration above shows the different ways to connect developers to apps, directly or throw teams

## Direct collaboration

Collaborate on a specific app with another developer. Invite another developer for access only one app. Use this workflow when an agency is working with external solo freelancers, or solo freelancers are collaborating on apps.

## Team collaboration

Work together on multiple apps in a team of developers with simple role based access. Instead of sharing app by app, share access to a group of apps with a group of people. Please see our [team guide](/10.objects/4.team.md) on how to setup and use.
