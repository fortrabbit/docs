### Which plan is right for me?

Scaling depends on the type of your application and the traffic it serves. Start with small and go on from there. Consult your developer.

### Can I test it for free?

Yes! It is possible to test a medium preset without obligations. You can even ask us to extend your trial period. Upgrade to a paid version when you are convinced.

### Can I switch to yearly payments?

Yearly payments are not supported because we do not accept upfront payments because the costs and the exact usage can not be predicted in advance. fortrabbit has pro-rated billing after usage.

### Can I pay by PayPal?

Sorry. PayPal is NOT supported.

### My credit card is not accepted!

Sorry. We pass the data to our payment processor directly. They deal with the credit card companies to accept or reject cards. Debit cards are more likely not be accepted. Cards from countries in Asia and Africa are less likely to be accepted.
