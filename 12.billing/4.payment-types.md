## Credit card

Visa, MasterCart and Amex are the supported credit cards. Many debit cards are not supported, some are, try it out. US clients might need to ask their bank to allow payments from us. When setting up the payment option we'll do a test charge. That's not a real charge. You may get a notification about this.

## SEPA direct debit

SEPA direct debit is accessible to clients in the European Union.
