## About domains on fortrabbit

Please note that fortrabbit does not provide domain registration services. An "external domain" is a domain registered with a third party service.

Each fortrabbit app-environment has its own, unique environment URL for testing purposes. Additionally you can "route" any number of external domains to your App. Essentially that means that you can host a PHP application under a dedicated domain name on fortrabbit, that you have registered with a third party domain name registrar.
