## This is not VPS hosting

The fortrabbit platform has a service oriented architecture with individually scalable as components. The [app environment](/10.objects/2.app-environment.md) are lightweight containers that are optimized for speedy web delivery of PHP applications. If you are shopping for as much hardware resources as possible for as little money as possible, you might look elsewhere.

## No 1-click installers

When creating an app we ask for the desired software you are about to use. This can be Laravel, Craft CMS, WordPress or alike. That will not install the software. Read more more about the [software presets here](/11.concepts/software-presets.md).

## No root shell

The SSH environment is "jailed". So you can use it for deployment and for common tasks around development. Therefore, it's NOT possible to install software like: FFmpeg, Node, NPM, Gulp, webpack, ruby, Rails or a mail server. We do this for security and performance and security design reasons.

## Need to call via php interpreter

To launch a PHP script you need to specify the PHP interpreter explicitly: for example, `php artisan` or `php craft`.

## No image optimization tools

Tools like `jpegoptim`, `optipng`, `pngquant`, `SVGO`, `gifsicle` and alike can help to reduce file size of your images. Using such tools are considered a best practice today. Unfortunately they consume a lot of CPU time and memory. fortrabbit apps are build for fast short running light processes, not heavy lifting. Consider using a third party service for this.

## No video compressing

`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` alike are also not available to avoid overuse of resources.

## wkhtmltopdf

wkhtmltopdf is a popular library to convert HTML to PDF. It's NOT installed and you can not install it on your own for the reasons named above. Check out the following alternatives:

* [dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf) is a PHP only PDF by CSS renderer
* Use PDF as a service
* Rethink if you really need PDF?
* Consider PDF creation on the client side with JS in the browser, with [jsPDF](https://parall.ax/products/jspdf) or similar

## Security responsibilities

We believe in a clear division of security concerns. We - fortrabbit - take care of the Operating System level and the PHP runtime, you - the developer - are responsible for the software you write and use.

## Service location

A data center can be chosen for each app individually, but can't be changed later on. The service is available in Euro (€) or US Dollars ($): This can be chosen with each [payment method](/10.objects/9.payment-method.md). The fortrabbit headquarters is based in Berlin, time zone is: CET.

## Mailing

**Sendmail — the Mail Transfer Agent — is not available on fortrabbit.** In PHP Sendmail is usually used with the `mail()` function. Back in the good ol' days, this would simply call the shell command `sendmail` from the shell to send a mail directly from the web server to the receiving mail server. In recent days, this is a really bad practice: your web server can send mails, but not receive any - it is not a mail server. So it is not distinguishable from any home PC part of a bot net. Long story short: it is very likely that your mail will not be received.

### Direct SMTP

There is no mailing built-in here. Instead of `sendmail` you can use a mail script that uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) via your e-mail provider - usually the one that provides your domain - directly.

There are countless possibilities how to use SMTP. Most frameworks and CMS give them to you out of the box. If you use a custom script, have a look at [Swift Mailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/). There are special solutions for [WordPress](), [Laravel]() & [Symfony]().

A better solution might be to use a "transactional mail service", those are built to do the bulk mailing — see [transactional mail](/13.integrations/3.transactional-mail-providers.md).

## PHP PATH_INFO

Our runtime implements PHP via FastCGI + FPM. To utilize `PATH_INFO` you need to do a small hack-around in your `.htaccess` file:

```
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.php/ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.+)\.php/(.+)$    /$1.php [NC,L,QSA,E=PATH_INFO:/$2]
```

## Authorization header

<!-- TODO: Accurate still? -->

If you need the `Authorization` header, for OAuth for example, you have to forward the header explicitly via an ENV variable:

```apache
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
```

## Outgoing IP address

In some cases you need to know your app environment's IP address, for payment processing or for networks that are behind a firewall. The IP address of app environments is not guaranteed to be persistent. Although it will most probably not change during the lifetime of an App. You can see this for yourself with a PHP script. Querying an HTTP service like that from an App is the easiest way to determine the current IP address.

```php
<?php
echo file_get_contents("https://ifconfig.co/");
```

Depending on your needs, it is possible to use an HTTP proxy provider like [QuoteGuard](https://www.quotaguard.com/) to get a static IP address. Finally, there is also the [official list of AWS IP ranges](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) and the same list in [JSON](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) format.

## What this isn't

We don't offer some classical hosting standards such as:

* Plesk, cPanel, ISPconfig, any classical hosting control panel
* e-mail hosting, e-mail address configuration, webmail
* Domain ordering, top level domain registration services
* pre-installed phpMyAdmin, phpBB, Wikis …
* one-click installers
