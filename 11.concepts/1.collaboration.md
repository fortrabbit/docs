## Workflows

- Solo freelancers working for clients directly
- Solo freelancers working for organizations
- Smaller organizations with a fixed team, plus external freelancers
- Bigger organizations with multiple teams, plus external freelancers

## Personal access

We expect you to sign up as an individual, not a company. In fact the account is part of the [person object](/10.objects/3.person.md). Mind that your personal [public SSH keys](/14.tips/ssh-keys.md) are also stored with your account.

| Person      | Team                  | App               | Payment method        |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| human being | a group of developers | website / web app | an object owning apps |
| active      | passive               | passive           | passive               |

## Developers and clients

You can choose your account type when signing up and change it later on.

- Client: a non technical person only managing billing
- Developer: a person with tech skills managing hosting and maybe billing

### App collaboration

Use case: Collaborate on a specific app with another developer. Invite another developer for access only one app.

### Team collaboration

Use case: Work together on multiple apps in a team of developers. Please see our [team guide](/10.objects/4.team.md) on how to setup and use.

## Billing collaboration

In many cases the billing manager is not a developer. This can be the client or someone from the billing department or the client of the freelancing developer. See [payment method](/10.objects/9.payment-method.md) to proceed.

## Events

Every interaction with the fortrabbit services will be recorded and associated with you. In the dashboard those actions are shown as [events](/10.objects/events.md) and are important part of collaboration and help with accountability.
