## What the web storage contains

Please keep in mind, that the Git repo is not a one to one representation of the web storage. After you Git push, first the Git repo will be updated, then changes will be synchronised (overwrite but not delete) to the web storage. So the web storage contains:

1. The latest Git changes synced in
2. Changes from SFTP & SSH
3. Uploads from website users

## Choosing a workflow

You can mix deployment methods, but not interchange the different deployment methods. Choose your main deployment method upfront.

Use the workflow that matches your skills and the requirements of the software you are using. In general we advice to work with Git, as it is: faster, more secure, it also includes an additional code backup with rollback and — with fortrabbit — Composer is also already integrated.

## Mixing deployment methods

It's not black and white either. When working with Git, you often will use some SSH/SFTP in addition — to deploy generated assets and manage user uploads for example.
