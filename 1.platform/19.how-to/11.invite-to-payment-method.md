## Get ready

Understand that an account at fortrabbit represents a person. [Apps](/1.platform/10.objects/1.app.md) are owned by [payment methods](/1.platform/10.objects/9.payment-method.md), which are objects that are controlled by [people](/1.platform/10.objects/3.person.md). See [billing collaboration](/16.collaboration/3.billing-collaboration.md) for the concepts.

## Use cases

Use the 'invite to payment method' flow to invite someone to access an existing payment method. The invited person can be a non technical business owner (client, see [account types](/16.collaboration/7.account-types.md)) or a tech-savvy developer to connect a team. Use this flow to invite:

- A co-founder of a startup or agency
- Someone from the billing department
- Another team

Depending on the [account type](/16.collaboration/7.account-types.md) people connected to a payment method can:

- Clients and developers: receive invoices, change the billing credentials
- Developers: attach the payment method to new apps or existing apps

## How it works

This describes the app invite flow from both sides:

### On the inviter side

1. You need to have a [billing connection](/16.collaboration/5.billing-connection.md) to a [payment method](/1.platform/10.objects/1.app.md)
2. In the dashboard, find the link
3. Select the apps you like them to pay
4. Enter the email address of payee

:BlockLink{title="invite to payment method" path="/invite/payment-method"}

### On the invited side

1. Receive an email with an invite link
2. Login to fortrabbit or create a new account for this
3. Accept the invite and follow the steps to create or choose a new payment method for the apps

### Consequences

- The inviter will loose their [billing connection](/16.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md) to the app
- The inviter will keep the [developer connection](/16.collaboration/5.developer-connection.md)
- The invited account is in power to delete the app or assign other developers
- It's also possible to connect a team to a payment method
- All interactions are recorded as [events](/1.platform/10.objects/events.md)

## Alternatives

This flow is specifically made to share access on a payment method. You can also invite someone to a [take over billing](/16.collaboration/12.invite-to-pay.md).

With team collaboration members with unlimited access - [see team roles](/16.collaboration/8.team-roles.md) - automatically have access to payment methods that are connected to the team.
