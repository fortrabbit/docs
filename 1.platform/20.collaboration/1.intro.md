## Personal access

Sign up to fortrabbit as an individual person, not a company or entity. See [account organization](/1.platform/03.concepts/01.account-organization.md) and the [person object](/1.platform/10.objects/03.person.md) for more details on why and how to use your personal account. For most scenarios, you a person will only need one account and one login.

## Two levels of collaboration

There are two types of collaboration on the fortrabbit hosting platform:

- [Developer collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/2.developer-collaboration.md) - sharing technical aspects
- [Billing collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/3.billing-collaboration.md) - sharing billing access

This enables to share developer access to an app without sharing billing access at the same time. It's also the foundation to work with non-technical business owners (clients).

With teams it's practical that the unlimited members have combined control on developer access and billing access.
