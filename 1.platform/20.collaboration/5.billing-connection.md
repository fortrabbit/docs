## What you can do with a billing connection

- Add/remove developers and teams
- Delete apps
- Create apps
- Change the [payment method](/1.platform/10.objects/09.payment-method.md)

## Who can have a billing connection?

- Developers and clients, see [account types](/1.platform/20.collaboration/7.account-types.md)

## Billing connection types

One can either have direct billing connection or through a team.

### Direct billing connection

You can have your own personal payment method that can also be shared. You can also be invited or invite other developers to directly connect to an app you have access on.

### Team billing connections

Team members with unlimited access - see [team roles](/1.platform/20.collaboration/8.team-roles.md)- have access on all payment methods connected to the team.

## Relation to developer connection

A similar concept is the [developer connection](/1.platform/20.collaboration/6.developer-connection.md), which defines how a person has technical access on an app.
