## Understand individual access

An account on fortrabbit represents a person, not an entity. Your account settings are part of your [personal access](/1.platform/10.objects/03.person.md) to the fortrabbit system. You can choose your type of account when signing up and change it later on if you made mistake initially.

## Developer

As a developer you are exposed to all dashboard and platform features. You have technical access to apps and all collaboration features such as teams. Developers can:

- Create and delete teams
- Collaborate in teams
- Create, delete and change apps
- Create, delete and change environments
- Deploy code to environments
- Create, delete and change payment methods
- Change billing for apps

## Client

As a client you have limited access on the dashboard. Most technical aspects are hidden to remove unnecessary complexity. A client account is also a personal login and should not be shared. A client can be the client of a freelancing developer or an agency. It can also be the boss or someone from the billing department. Clients have the power to manage billing aspects and certain parts of collaboration. This includes:

- Add and remove developers and teams to apps
- Delete apps
- Create, delete and change payment methods
- Change billing for apps

### Convenience

The client features are freeing you from babysitting the billing setup with your client. It's a more enjoyable experience for your client too. They are in control, yet not overwhelmed.

### Responsibility

The most important part of the client feature is separation of concerns. When the website goes down because of service issues with us, we - not you the developer - need to face the client. For that, we have the service level agreement with your client directly. And when your client forgets to pay the hosting fees or to update the payment credentials, it's our job to run after the money.

### Not limited

While the client feature is popular and recommended, we know that it will not fit all business workflows. More corporate clients might have restrictions on 3rd party providers, or you simply prefer to have a yearly retainer with your client. That's why there are additional workflows for consolidated billing using payment methods to be separated or shared by teams or projects.
