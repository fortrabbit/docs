## Use cases

A [team](/1.platform/10.objects/04.team.md) is group of developers working together on multiple apps. Use this flow to invite a developer to collaborate on multiple (current and future) apps and take part in the team as well. Invite people you know well and trust.

## How it works

This describes the team invite flow from both sides:

### On the inviter side

1. You need to have unlimited access on a [team](/1.platform/10.objects/04.team.md) already
2. In the dashboard, find the link.
3. Select the team you like to invite someone to
4. Select the role of the invited developer - see [team roles](/1.platform/20.collaboration/8.team-roles.md)
5. Select the apps they should have access on - see [developer connection](/1.platform/20.collaboration/6.developer-connection.md)
6. Enter the email address of your colleague

:BlockLink{title="invite to team" path="/new/invite/team"}

### On the invited side

1. They receive an email with an invite link
2. They login to their fortrabbit account or create a new account for this
3. Then they need to accept the invite

### Consequences

- They will become part of your team with role you selected for them
- Their [team role](/1.platform/20.collaboration/8.team-roles.md) defines their access level

## Alternative app invite

You can also invite developers or teams to specific apps, see [the app invite flow](/1.platform/20.collaboration/19.how-to/09.invite-to-app.md).
