A technical contact is a [person](/1.platform/10.objects/03.person.md) with a [developer connection](/1.platform/20.collaboration/6.developer-connection.md) to the app - usually the responsible developer with good knowledge of the project and code base. Think 'web master'.

Each [app](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md) should have one or more technical contacts associated. There is a dashboard setting with the app to select technical contacts from a list of developers connected with the app. By default, the developer creating the app will be assigned.

fortrabbit staff may get in touch with the technical contacts by e-mail to inform about important updates related to specific apps. Examples are:

- Software vulnerabilities
- Important software updates or incompatibilities
- Targeted DDoS attacks
- Excessive resource over-usage
- Suspicious activities
- Website hacked

Pro-actively contacting customers about important issues is done by fortrabbit at a best effort basis. fortrabbit does not guarantee contact coverage for any potential problem. It remains the responsibility of the customer to keep the software up-dated, as well as the list of technical contacts.
