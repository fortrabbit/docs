## Support example

> I have 10k views. How much do I need to pay for hosting?

How do you define views? Maybe this is page views in Google Analytics? But how many PHP requests does a page view require, and what is the average response time? Also, over which time frame is 10k views?

## Evaluate hosting requirements

Getting to know your actual hosting requirements can be surprisingly hard. For new projects where development has not yet even started important metrics are missing. For existing projects that are hosted elsewhere it's not easy either. An educated guess is better than nothing.

- Storage and database sizes are easy to measure.
- Comparing CPU and compute requirements is hard. With fortrabbit, the memory shown for PHP is not the same as memory on a VPS.
- Code quality plays a major role too. Good code can fly. See the [performance section](/3.dev/02.performance/).

### Hosting requirements by software

In our experience, software systems can very roughly be categorized in hardware requirements, specifically in regard of PHP power required, see [PHP processes](/3.dev/02.performance/06.php-processes.md).

| Category | Software                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light    | [WordPress](/2.guides/6.wordpress/), [Kirby CMS](/2.guides/4.kirby/) ...                                    |
| Medium   | [Statamic](/2.guides/5.statamic/), [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel/), [Craft CMS](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/) ... |
| Heavy    | [Typo3](/2.guides/7.more/), [Symfony](/2.guides/7.more/), [Shopware](/2.guides/7.more/) ...                 |

## fortrabbit product structure

There is not one hosting plan to select. There are [apps](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md), [environments](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md) and [components](/1.platform/09.components/) available in different plans. See [pricing structure](/1.platform/12.billing/01.pricing-structure.md).

## fortrabbit pricing

Our [public pricing](https:www.fortrabbit.com/pricing) and the component booking page looks like this:

```plain
              P R E S E T S
┌───────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌───────────┐
│ Classic v │ │ Flat file v │ │ Web app v │
└───────────┘ └─────────────┘ └───────────┘

           C O M P O N E N T S

 ‣ PHP XS                               $1
──────────────────────────────────────────
 ‣ MySQL SM                             $2
──────────────────────────────────────────
 ‣ Storage LG                           $3
──────────────────────────────────────────
 ‣ Traffic XS                           $1

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   TOTAL                                $7
```

### Presets

The selects on the top act as a quick chooser for the components below. Popular combinations for different software systems are available in t-shirt sizes. Use a preset that matches your software if you are unsure. Start with XS and enable [autoscaling](/1.platform/12.billing/11.autoscaling.md).

- Classic: LAMP stack based
- Flat file: Database-less
- Web app: Advanced setups

A preset is just a pre-configuration. It's not a fixed plan. Change individual aspects at any time.

### Components

[Components](/1.platform/03.concepts/02.components.md) can be booked and scaled individually. Each component is available in different t-shirt sizes, see [plans](/1.platform/12.billing/20.plans.md). Each plan has a [tier](/1.platform/12.billing/30.tiers.md).

## Start small, measure, scale, repeat

Create a [free trail](/1.platform/02.get-started/02.free-trial.md). Deploy code, watch performance and hosting metrics in the dashboard, then scale components up or down to experiment.
