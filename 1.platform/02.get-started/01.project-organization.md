## Intro

The fortrabbit platform has two layers to map web projects:

- [App](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md): Git repo, [collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/1.intro.md).
- [Environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md): Runtime, git branch, code access, [components](/1.platform/03.concepts/02.components.md), settings.

## Workflows

There is a main way to set this up and a couple of other possible workflows that are more or less sub-optimal:

### Projects as apps, environments are stages

```raw
- App: 'My website project'
  - Environment 1: 'Main' - live production
  - Environment 2: 'Dev' - feature development (optional)
```

Use environments as versions of the website. When using [git deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md), branches can be mapped to environments. See the [multi staging article](/3.dev/15.learn/03.staging-environments.md). Each app requires at least one environment. One app with one environment is also common.

### Projects as folders in an environment

```raw
- App: 'My agency'
  - Environment 1: 'Main'
    - Folders: 'website-1', 'website-2' …
```

Web projects are just folders in a single environment. This might be viable for micro sites, but has some downsides. When routing domains, `.htaccess` must be used. Resources like the database need to be shared.

Many CMS systems offer multi-site features, which works in a similar way. There are use cases for it, but in general individual installations will work better.

### Project parts as environments

```raw
- App: 'website-1'
  - Environment 1: 'frontend'
  - Environment 2: 'backend'
```

Environments map to parts of a web project. This may work for headless CMS systems, where frontend and backend are separated software.

### Projects as environments

```raw
- App: 'My agency'
  - Environment 1: 'website-1'
  - Environment 2: 'website-2'
  - Environment 3: 'website-3'
```

Web projects map to environments. This might be viable for tiny micro sites, but is sub-optimal. Resources and settings are shared. Individual web project access in collaboration is not possible.

Rating: ❌ ❌ ❌ ✅

### Projects as apps, stages as folders

```raw
- App: 'website-1'
  - Environment 1: 'Main'
    - Folders: 'prod', 'staging'
```

In this workflow, environments are ignored, instead stages are mapped as folders in one environment. This may not work as intended.
