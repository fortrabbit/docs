## Evaluating hosting requirements is hard

> I have 10k views. How much do I need to pay for hosting?

How do you define views? Maybe this means page views in Google Analytics. But how many PHP requests does a page view require, and what is the average response time? Also, over which time frame is 10k views?

Storage and database sizes are easy to measure.

Comparing CPU and compute requirements is hard. With fortrabbit, the memory shown for PHP is not the same as memory on a VPS.

The software also plays a role. Certain systems need more power, and eCommerce platforms usually need more headroom.

Code quality plays a major role too. Good code can fly. See the [performance section](/3.dev/02.performance/).

## Start small, measure, scale

[Components](/1.platform/03.concepts/02.components.md) can be booked and scaled individually. Use a preset that matches your software if you are unsure. Start with XS and enable [autoscaling](/1.platform/12.billing/11.autoscaling.md).

Create a [free trail](/1.platform/02.get-started/02.free-trial.md). Deploy code, watch performance and hosting metrics in the dashboard, then scale components up or down to experiment.
