## Starting a new trial

Create a new app in to the dashboard. Each new app starts as a free trial.

## Trial time limit

72 hours is time limit for the trial. A countdown timer in the dashboard with the app will show you the time left. You can contact support to extend your trial time. Write us something about your goals with the trial and why you need more time. In most cases, we are happy to extend your trial time.

## Trial end

When setting an app in trial mode you can define what shall happen when the trial period ends:

### Opt-in

- no credit card required
- the app will be deleted at the end of the trial time
- upgrade at any time before to keep it

### Opt-out

- credit card required (no charges during trial)
- start paying after the trial ends
- cancel at any time before
- required to trial large plans or multiple environments

## Starting over

You can start a new trial app, once the last one is expired.
