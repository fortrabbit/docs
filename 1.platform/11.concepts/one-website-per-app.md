## Issues with multiple websites per server

- website A needs runtime version y, while website B requires version x
- website C has a nasty bug and crashes the whole server
- website D has a security vulnerability, the whole server gets hacked
- website E gets receives lots of traffic, slowing the other websites down
- website A should be moved to a different agency

## Solved by app hosting

- Apps start can be individually scaled up
- Apps are isolated from each other
- Each app has its own settings and runtime versions
- Each app has individual web space
- Each app can have a dedicated Git repo
- Each app has its own collaboration access settings
- Each app has its own performance metrics
