navigation.excerpt: Live code examples

When you are currently logged in to the Dashboard (a cookie is stored), you will see a select box on the right side here - with a select to choose one of your app environments. It will change appropriate code examples on the current page according to the selected environment. So you can literary copy/paste all code examples here.

Try it out by changing the select to the right and watch the values below:

```plain
{{app-name}} - name of the currently selected app.
{{app-env-name}} - name of currently selected environment.
{{app-env-id}} - ID of the currently selected environment.
```
