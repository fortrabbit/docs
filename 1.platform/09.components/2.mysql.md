## Booking a database

A database is an optional component available in different plans. Each [app environment](/1.platform/10.objects/2.app-environment.md) can have one database component containing one database booked. The database can have multiple tables of course. Currently, only MySQL databases are available.

## Configuring the database

When the database is enabled, multiple settings and metrics become available in the dashboard. Please refer to the [database section](/8.database/index.md) to learn more.

## Scaling the database

Database plans differ mostly in the available storage, as well as the associated computing power. Usually MySQL and [PHP](/1.platform/9.components/1.php.md) are scaled alongside since they rely on each other. Start small, scale on demand.

### Database OFF

The database is optional on fortrabbit. Your application may not require a database at all. [Kirby](/2.guides/5.more/6.kirby.md), [Statamic](/2.guides/4.statamic/index.md) and [Grav](/2.guides/5.more/7.grav.md) as static file systems are not requiring MySQL in the basic setup at all. Or maybe you run a [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel/index.md) application that only consumes a third party API or uses [Redis](8.redis.md). Please refer to the software requirements of your CMS or framework.

### Shared plans

These are the most commonly used plans. Indeed the XS and the S plan are covering most normal website scenarios already. You can store a lot of text in 256 MB.

### Dedicated plans

Higher plans are available for heavy users and large databases.

### Autoscaling

MySQL has an autoscaling option. When turned on the next tier will be booked, once the storage limit is reached.

### Backups

MySQL plans do not offer backups. But those are available as an extra [backup component](5.backups.md).
