## Booking

Web storage is a required component available in different plans. Each environment needs to have storage booked.

## Configuration

The storage is integrated as a persistent file system. You have direct [code access](/1.platform/04.code-access/01.intro.md) by [SSH](/1.platform/04.code-access/03.ssh.md) and [SFTP](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md). The storage contains the deployed code, as well as runtime data, such as uploads and temporary files. See the [directory structure article](/1.platform/04.code-access/05.directories.md) to learn about pre-configured folders. The dashboard shows metrics about the storage size.

## Scaling

When [autoscaling](/1.platform/12.billing/11.autoscaling.md) is enabled, smaller and larger plans are automatically booked, based on usage. When autoscaling is disabled, the storage is capped at the chosen plan. Once the limit is reached, the environment can not write on the file system until space is cleaned. Web storage may grow over time as your website writes more files to the disk. Keep an eye on the metrics provided in the dashboard.

## Backups

Web storage backups are available through the additional [backup component](05.backups.md).
