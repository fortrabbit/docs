## Booking

Traffic measures the data transfer that is caused by visitors browsing around your website (environment). It is booked per [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md). Traffic is a passive component. It just happens. The max usage is billed over the month. It's designed in tiers and as most websites have predictable traffic patterns you can expect the same costs monthly. Most websites hosted here stay on the lowest tier.

## Scaling

It's recommended to have autoscaling enabled to allow more visitors. When autoscaling is disabled, the traffic will capped at the chosen level. Once the limit is reached, the environment will go offline until the next billing cycle (next month) or until the plan will be upgraded. When autoscaling is turned on (default), the next tier will be booked automatically once the current limit is reached, you will be billed more. When turned off, the website will go offline, once the limit is reached.

In many cases, increased traffic usage will correlate with more website visitors. This also can have an effect on other booked resources.

## Avoid website obesity

Keep the footprint of your website slim. Send as few bytes over the wire as possible, so that you can serve more visitors with the same amount of traffic. Reducing your website weight will also make it load faster for your visitors and improve your SEO score. See also [topic performance](/3.dev/02.performance/).
