Backups are an optional scalable component available per environment in various plans. They include file and database backups, see [working with backup files](/1.platform/25.backups/files.md). The encrypted backups are stored off-site on a block storage and do not count towards your [storage](03.storage.md) usage. Backups can be downloaded from the dashboard, [backup restore](/1.platform/25.backups/restore.md) is offered too.

The number of backups created depends on your plan size, see [backup retention](/1.platform/25.backups/retention.md). The [backup schedule](/1.platform/25.backups/retention.md) will start after booking. The first daily backup will become available the next day. On the next Monday, the weekly backup spot will be filled. On the first of the month the monthly backup will be stored.
