Jobs is an optional [component](/1.platform/03.concepts/02.components.md) that can be booked and scaled per [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md) in the dashboard. The scaling increases in available RAM and number of jobs.

```raw
┌─────────┐                        ┌───────────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ visitor │ ◀─ Request/response ─▶ │  environment  │ ◀──▶ │ worker/cron │
└─────────┘                        └───────────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

Jobs run in a separate runtime container with access to the environment's file system and [database](/1.platform/09.components/2.mysql.md). They are deferred from the front-end web layer to a background process that operates outside the web request/response life-cycle. This ensures that web requests are delivered swiftly, even when heavy processing is happening in the background. Environment variables and settings are kept in sync.

## Job types

Worker jobs and cron jobs are widely supported by modern PHP frameworks like [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel) and [Symfony](/2.guides/7.more/8.symfony.md), as well as CMS systems like [Craft CMS](/craft-cms) and [Statamic](/statamic).

- [Workers](/1.platform/30.jobs/03.workers.md): Non-stop running in the background, event driven triggers
- [Crons](/1.platform/30.jobs/02.crons.md): Scheduled at certain times

## Scaling

The available job plans differ in available memory and the number of jobs, that can be booked. Use the dashboard metrics to understand usage to determine the right plan to choose. Experiment with different plans to find the optimal scaling the project requires.

## Performance

Beside scaling up the component to improve performance, consider code refactoring or adjusting usage patterns.

### Sign of bad performance

- Overlapping jobs not finishing in decent time
- Increased 503 or 504 errors are
