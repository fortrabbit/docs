---

## Get ready

You should have a domain created with the fortrabbit dashboard. See the [domain setup guide](/1.platform/13.dns/2.external-domain-setup.md).

## What's a domain provider?

Your domain provider, sometimes called domain registrar, is the service where you purchased the domain. Common names are as GoDaddy, Enom, or Name.com. See [general domain provider integration](/1.platform/15.integrations/10.domain-providers.md) as well.

## How does the domain provider relate to fortrabbit?

fortrabbit does not provide domain registration or name servers. Instead you point the external domain to fortrabbit using DNS instructions.

## Instructions for domain providers

Below are links to instructions to set CNAME and A-records for specific domain providers. These settings are typically configured through the provider's control panel.
