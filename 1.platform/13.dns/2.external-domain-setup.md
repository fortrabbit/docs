## 1. Tell fortrabbit about your domain

1. Click New > "Add a new domain" and follow the steps
2. Choose a domain name and an environment
3. Keep the overview tab open to copy the desired DNS settings

:BlockLink{title="Add a new domain" path="/new/domain"}

## 2. Point the domain to fortrabbit

Use the provided DNS information from the fortrabbit dashboard to change the domain routing with your domain provider.

- For sub domains like www, use the CNAME record
- Apex domains get an A record for [forwarding](/1.platform/13.dns/5.domain-forwarding.md)
- Leave any other records untouched, especially MX
- Remove any AAAA records (IPV6)

Save the settings with your domain provider and wait a while. The while depends on the TTL settings of the DNS records, or usually up to 6h.
