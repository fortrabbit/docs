## Features

- It uses '301 Moved Permanently' headers
- It works for `https`
- It also works for deep links like `https://your-domain.com/page`
- It works for `www.` and other subdomains

## General usage

[Domains](/1.platform/10.objects/10.domain.md) registered with the dashboard have a target setting. You can choose to route the domain directly to the root path of an environment or to be forwarded.

### Limitations

- The target of a forwarded domain needs to be routed directly
- It is not possible to forward a domain to a forwarded domain
- Deleting a domain will delete domains forwarded to this domain as well

## Forwarded apex domains

When adding a www domain to the dashboard you will be provided a CNAME record (host name) for the www prefix and another domain for the apex domain. Here the routing is via A record (IP address). The IP address is the forwarding service. You will add both records with your [domain provider](/4.intergrations/01.dns/01.intro.md).

### Recommendations

- Use `www.domain.tld` instead of just `domain.tld` in all links
- Send your external traffic (e.g. advertisement clicks) to the `www.` domain
- Configure your uptime checks with a URL to the the `www.` domain

## Alternatives

You don't have to use the fortrabbit free domain forwarding service, other options:

- [ALIAS / ANAME routing](/1.platform/13.dns/aname-alias-records.md)
- Forwarding, using your domain provider
- Use `.htaccess` for more fine tuned control, see [htaccess redirects](/3.dev/21.htaccess/2.redirects.md)
