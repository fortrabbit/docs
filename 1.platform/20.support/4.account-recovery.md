## You have access to the email

When you know the email that has been used for the account here and you have access to it: proceed by resetting the account password. This way you regain access and set a new password so that only you can login.

## You don't have access to the email

If you don't know the account email used or you don't have access on the email tell us details that only you — the legit owner of the business — can know. More is better:

- last two digits of the current credit card in use
- a previous invoice number
- amount of the last invoice
- name of your apps hosted here
- links to LinkedIn profiles
- details from conversations we have had in support
- a funny commit message you can recall
- a detail or a comment in the code
- names and e-mail addresses of other team members
- tell us the whole story why you don't have access any more
- plus anything else that helps us identifying you as the real owner
