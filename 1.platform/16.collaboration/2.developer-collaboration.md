## Get ready

Have a look at the [collaboration intro](/16.collaboration/1.intro.md) to understand the basics of the fortrabbit collaboration features.

The illustration above shows the different ways to connect developers to apps, directly or through teams.

## Direct app access and collaboration

Suited for freelancers, solo developers and solopreneurs. By default apps are directly attached to your personal account. Use cases:

- Personal projects, portfolios, learning, weekend hacks
- Direct client work

It's possible to share developer access on an app by app basis. You can invite a colleague, or another freelancer to specific apps:

## Team collaboration

Work together on multiple apps in a team of developers with simple role based access. Instead of sharing app by app, share access to a group of apps with a group of people.
