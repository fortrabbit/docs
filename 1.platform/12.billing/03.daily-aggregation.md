If you book a plan on the 16th day or create an app or environment, the invoice items will be calculated for 15 active usage days. The dollar signs indicate days that would be included in the invoice:

```plain
       April
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
     -  -  -  -  -
 -  -  -  -  -  -  -
 -  -  -  $  $  $  $
 $  $  $  $  $  $  $
 $  $  $  $
```

The above example gives you a clue that we are charging after usage, see [proration](/1.platform/12.billing/02.postpaid.md). First you use the service, at the end of the service period, actual costs are calculated together and invoiced.

## Examples

```yml
# Adding a component mid-month:
Monthly rate: €30
Start date: 15th
Days used: 16
Charge: €16 (€30 ÷ 30 × 16)

# Upgrading a plan:
Old plan: €30/month (€1/day)
New plan: €60/month (€2/day)
Charge: €19 (19 days × €1) + €22 (11 days × €2)
```

## Benefits

The daily cost usage aggregation promotes testing, tinkering and experimenting without much obligations and having to pay a fortune.

- Create a environment to test a feature branch for a couple of days
- Test best settings for scaling the production environment
- Scale up hosting resources for temporary events such as media coverage

## The largest plan counts

Let's say you want to find the best matching PHP plan size. For that you scale up and down the PHP plan while monitoring PHP response time and reloading the website to see effects in performance. On that day, PHP XS, PHP SM and PHP MD may have been in use. The invoice will show PHP MD for that day.

## Monthly prices for reference

In our experience website projects most often run over months and even years. That's why monthly prices are most appropriate to show and reason about.

## 30 days monthly base

Some months have 31 days, while February has either 28 or 29 days. To ensure consistency in monthly invoices, all months are normalized to 30 days. This means that when a component is booked for an entire month, it is always billed for 30 days.

The daily price is calculated as 1/30th of the monthly price. If a component is used for less than a full month, the cost is determined by multiplying the daily price (1/30th of the monthly price) by the number of days the component was active.

## No hourly prices

Some other hosting vendors offer hourly prices. We believe, that this is confusing and does not match the reality of most projects. To get an idea for the daily price you only need to divide the monthly price by 30. In most cases this about cents, costs one need not to worry much about anyways.
