## Plan resources

Each plan includes specific hardware resources and performance limits. Detailed specifications are available with the pricing page. While most [components](/1.platform/02.concepts/03.components.md) represent single scalable resources (like traffic or storage), some plans combine multiple resources. For example, MySQL plans scale both storage capacity and computing power together.

## Tiers

Plans are grouped in carefully designed buckets. That makes the costs predictable and unlikely to fluctuate often over time. In fact most standard websites and applications will work with small plans just fine.

## Changing plans

Plans can be upgraded or downgraded at any time with immediate effect. Changes are [prorated](/1.platform/12.billing/4.proration.md) with [daily aggregation](3.daily-aggregation.md). Common reasons to change plans include:

- Handling increased traffic
- Optimizing costs during quiet periods
- Preparing for marketing campaigns
- Scaling for seasonal peaks

## Finding the right plan

Start small and scale up as needed. Each application has unique requirements that depend on:

- Traffic patterns
- Application architecture
- Caching strategy
- Database usage
- Storage needs

The monitoring tools help you track resource usage and determine when to scale. :ContactUs{text="Contact us"} if in doubt.

## Regional pricing

Plan prices vary by data center location due to local infrastructure costs. Consider this when choosing a region.
