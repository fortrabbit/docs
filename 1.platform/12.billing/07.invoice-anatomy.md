## Invoice item rows

Each invoice contains a number of rows. They are grouped by environment as each has a set of booked components. Each invoice row contains the booked component and it's plan and how many days it is billed for by days. The table gives you an idea how components and plans appear on an invoice.

| Component plan | Days billed | Daily price |  Month |
| -------------- | ----------: | ----------: | -----: |
| PHP XS         |          10 |       $0.10 | $15.00 |
| PHP S          |          20 |       $0.16 | $15.00 |
| Traffic S      |          30 |       $0.03 |  $1.00 |

In this example PHP XS was booked for a couple of days and then replaced by PHP S. See the [pro-rated billing article](4.proration.md) for more on that.
