Autoscaling is an option that can be toggled per environment with the component booking.

| Autoscaling | Fixed price | Availability   |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **On**      | ❌ No        | Stays online   |
| **Off**     | ✅ Yes       | May go offline |

Autoscaling is available applies to the following components in the following ways:

| Component       | Autoscaling | Metric    |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| MySQL           | ✅ Yes      | Storage   |
| Traffic         | ✅ Yes      | Bandwidth |
| Web storage     | ✅ Yes      | Space     |
| PHP             | ❌ No       | -         |
| Key-value store | ❌ No       | -         |
| Jobs            | ❌ No       | -         |
