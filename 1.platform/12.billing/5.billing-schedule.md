## The billing cycle

- End of the month: Invoices for the monthly usage are created
- 1st of the month: Invoices for the previous month are sent out
- 3rd of the month: Credit card payments are issued
- 7th of the month: SEPA direct payments are issued
- Until end of the month: Review and retry of bounced invoices, see [late payments](/1.platform/12.billing/23.late-payments.md)

## Monthly invoices

Within the first few days of every new month, you will get the invoice for the service period of the last month. After receiving the invoice, the payments are due and are charged automatically.
