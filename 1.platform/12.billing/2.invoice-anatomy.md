## Invoice details

- Invoice number - An individual number per invoice, customer, period.
- Invoice date - Invoices are printed at the last day of the month.
- Service period - The past month.
- Invoice recipient - A postal address copied from the payment method details.
- VAT info - Depending on country, VAT might be added. See the [VAT article](6.vat.md).

## Invoice item rows

Each invoice contains a number of rows. They are grouped by app environment as each has a set of booked components. Each invoice row contains the booked component and it's plan and how many days it is billed for by days. The table gives you an idea how components and plans appear on an invoice.

| Component plan | Days billed | Daily price |  Month |
| -------------- | ----------: | ----------: | -----: |
| PHP XS         |          10 |       $0.10 | $15.00 |
| PHP S          |          20 |       $0.16 | $15.00 |
| Traffic S      |          30 |       $0.03 |  $1.00 |

In this example PHP XS was booked for a couple of days and then replaced by PHP S. See the [pro-rated billing article](3.pro-rated-billing.md) for more on that.
