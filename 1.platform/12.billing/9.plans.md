## Plan resources

Each plan includes specific hardware resources and performance limits. Detailed specifications are available with the :PageLink{text="pricing page" prefix="wwwUrl" href="/pricing"}. While most [components](/1.platform/11.concepts/components.md) represent single scalable resources (like traffic or storage), some plans combine multiple resources. For example, MySQL plans scale both storage capacity and computing power together.

## Changing plans

Plans can be upgraded or downgraded at any time with immediate effect. Changes are [prorated](/1.platform/12.billing/3.pro-rated-billing.md). Common reasons to change plans include:

- Handling increased traffic
- Optimizing costs during quiet periods
- Preparing for marketing campaigns
- Scaling for seasonal peaks

## Finding the right plan

Start small and scale up as needed. Each application has unique requirements that depend on:

- Traffic patterns
- Application architecture
- Caching strategy
- Database usage
- Storage needs

## Regional pricing

Plan prices vary by data center location due to local infrastructure costs. Consider this when choosing a region.
