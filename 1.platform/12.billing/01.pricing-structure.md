The example diagram below illustrates the billable structure of a [payment method](/1.platform/10.objects/09.payment-method.md) with two [apps](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md), one with one [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md), the other with two environments. The environments have different [plans](/1.platform/12.billing/20.plans.md) of [components](/1.platform/03.concepts/02.components.md) booked.

```raw
- App 1 (takas)
  - Environment (production)
    - Components
      - PHP S
      - Web storage XS
      - Traffic S
      - Database OFF
      - …
- App 2 (project-earth)
  - Environment (production)
    - Components
      - PHP M
      - Web storage M
      - Database L
  - Environment (staging)
    - Components

```

Most component plans are available as shared resources. Some higher plans of components are available as 'dedicated'.
