## Fiscal implications

- Prices are shown as net prices, without Value Added Tax (VAT)
- No VAT is charged for customers outside EU
- No VAT is charged for registered business in EU (+ GB) with valid VATIN
- VAT is charged for VAT-registered business in Germany

## VATIN for EU clients

It's recommended to enter your VATIN (Value Added Tax Identification Number), sometimes referenced as VAT TAX ID or similar. This way you save upfront costs for VAT — reverse charge makes this possible.

## EU VAT exemption

We may not charge VAT, if article 151(1)(a) VAT Directive applies, e.g. for international bodies, embassies or other EU organizations with a valid VAT exemption certificate. Please get in touch if VAT exemption applies to your organization.
