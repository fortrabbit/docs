The threshold value may change over time and may be differ depending on currency and payment type. Consider something like 50 cent.

We use Stripe as our invoicing provider and their threshold functionality.

Invoices below threshold will be nullified automatically, so nothing needs to be paid. The amount will be added to the payment methods balance and applied to the next invoice.

## Example

```raw
€0.30 Invoice March -> Threshold applied
€4.50 Invoice April - Apply threshold from balance
€4.80 Amount due in April
```
