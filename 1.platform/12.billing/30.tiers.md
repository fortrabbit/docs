Usage based components are sized in practical ranges so that costs stay predictable and mostly flat. Best illustrated with an example: With web traffic the smallest plan includes 32 GiB. This tier is sufficient for 96% of all websites, resulting in highly predictable costs and usually no cost jumps month by month.
