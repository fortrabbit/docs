The example diagram below illustrates the billable structure of a [payment method](/1.platform/10.objects/9.payment-method.md) with two [apps](/1.platform/10.objects/1.app.md), one with one [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/2.app-environment.md), the other with two environments. The environments have different [plans](/1.platform/12.billing/20.plans.md) of [components](/1.platform/11.concepts/components.md) booked.

```raw
- App 1 (takas)
  - Environment (production)
    - Components
      - PHP S
      - Web storage XS
      - Traffic S
      - Database OFF
      - …
- App 2 (project-earth)
  - Environment (production)
    - Components
      - PHP M
      - Web storage M
      - Database L
  - Environment (staging)
    - Components
      - …
```

Most component plans are available as shared resources. Some higher plans of components are available as 'dedicated'.

<!-- ## Billing collaboration

At fortrabbit a payment method holds the apps. A payment method is an object that has payment credentials attached and receives the invoices. Different people may have access on the payment method to change it and receive invoices. See the [payment method article](/1.platform/10.objects/9.payment-method.md) for more.
