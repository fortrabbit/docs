Different prices may apply based on the selected currency. It's also possible that prices differ by data center location.

- All payment methods within the EU are required to pay in EUR.
- [Payment methods](/1.platform/10.objects/9.payment-method.md) from other countries can pay in USD or EUR.

It is not possible to change the currency of a payment method later on. However, you can create a new payment method with a different currency and then move apps there.
