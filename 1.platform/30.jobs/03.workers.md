## About workers

A worker job is a long running task that is executing software, scripts or executables. The fortrabbit platform offers some additional abstraction. Workers are available with the [jobs component](/1.platform/09.components/07.jobs.md) and managed through the dashboard, see [job usage](/1.platform/30.jobs/01.usage.md). The job component runs in an isolated container, so that frontend and backend processes are separated.

Unlike crons, which offer scheduled execution of scripts, worker jobs can run non-stop in the background.

## Worker jobs use cases

- Image processing
- API communication
- Meta data aggregation

## Workers and deployments

Each successful [deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) will restart all running workers. This assures the jobs are running on the latest code base.
