<!--  TODO: review or maybe drop, it does not seem that BitBucket is used much any more - ALSO, no App only keys? ƒrank 2024-08-01 -->

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org?utm_source=fortrabbit), similar to GitHub, is a Git hosting service that offers advanced Git work-flows, such as 'pull requests'. It offers private repos in a free plan. It also offers [paid plans](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing) for "growing teams".

At the time of the writing, there is no fortrabbit Bitbucket app to automatically integrate Bitbucket.

## Deployment pipeline

Bitbucket has pipelines to handle hooks to build stuff. In order for , you have to [create an SSH key pair with Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-ssh-keys-in-bitbucket-pipelines-847452940.html) and then add the public key to fortrabbit.

### Example pipeline

The easiest way to deploy to fortrabbit from Bitbucket is to rsync the files, add this to your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`:

```yml
pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Deploy to STAGING
          deployment: staging
          script:
            - git push --force {staging-app-name}@deploy.{region}.frbit.com:{staging-app-name}.git HEAD:main
      - step:
          name: Deploy to PRODUCTION
          deployment: production
          trigger: manual
          script:
            - git push --force {production-app-name}@deploy.{region}.frbit.com:{production-app-name}.git HEAD:main
```

This simple workflow does not work if you are building assets in your pipeline that end up adding or changing files that you want to deploy.
