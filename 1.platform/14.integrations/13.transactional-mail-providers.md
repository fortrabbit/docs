### Sendmail is not an option any more

Back in the days you might have just used the [PHP mail function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php) like so:

```php
$to      = 'firstname.lastname@gmail.com';
$subject = 'Welcome to awesome service';
$message = 'hello, nice to have you here …';
$headers = 'From: webmaster@mycoolapp.com'

mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
```

This is not working any more these days, since such mails are sent anonymously — not from a real mail server. Your email not reach the inbox of your clients. Sendmail is disabled with our hosting service here for this reason, see [quirks](/1.platform/11.concepts/4.quirks.md#mailing).

## About transactional emails

Your web application needs to send personalized, triggered emails. For example:

1. double-opt in email to confirm an account
2. an email with the monthly invoice
3. an email to reset a password to login to your service again

This is not a newsletter where one person is sending out the same mail to a bulk of receivers, but a service that sends personalized mails one by one.

Commercial transactional mail offerings are here help. Beside an SMTP interface you'll get: an easy to use restful API, instant delivery, help with setting up your DKIM and SPF records for your domain, email templates, logging, statistics, bounce alerts, click tracking, inbound emails and much more.
