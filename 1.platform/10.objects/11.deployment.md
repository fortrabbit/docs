The deployment object displays metadata, including deployment logs, the issuer, the environment, and a link to the deployed commit.

Deployments are recorded only for Git deployments using the [official fortrabbit GitHub app](/3.dev/2.deployment/2.github-app.md). Deployments via GitHub Actions are not recorded. SSH/SFTP sessions are not considered deployments either. With the deployment settings of an environment you can control the rules for deployment. Please proceed to the [deployment section](/3.dev/2.deployment) to learn more.

With the dashboard you can see a list of deployments that can be filtered down. Each list item links to an individual deployment which provides more insights and links. Older deployment events might be partially or fully pruned.
