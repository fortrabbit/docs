## External domain

An "external domain" is a domain registered with a third party domain name registrar. fortrabbit does not provide domain registration services. Proceed here:

- [Domain provider integration](/1.platform/15.integrations/10.domain-providers.md) - combine domain provider with fortrabbit
- [External domains intro](/1.platform/13.dns/1.external-domains.md) - options and limits
- [Point an external domain](/1.platform/13.dns/2.external-domain-setup.md) - step by step instructions

## Target settings

For most domains the target can be changed. Target settings can not be changed for:

- apex domains: will always forward to their www counterpart
- main domains: define a different main domain first

### Environment setting

Change the environment of an external domain with this setting. External domains can be moved across environments without DNS changes. This can be useful when switching the production domain to a new environment.

### Root path setting

A root path is a folder in the [file system](/1.platform/04.code-access/05.directories.md) of the [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md) where a domain will end. The root path is saved with the environment for all it's domains. That means, no interface is offered to configure individual root paths per domain. You can however configure custom routing of domains in your code and config, either by `.htaccess` rules or by some routing options with your software.

### Domain forwarding

The dashboard allows you to forward domains with the same environment. Usually you will want to forward all domains to your main domain. See the [www domain forwarding article](/1.platform/13.dns/domain-forwarding.md).
