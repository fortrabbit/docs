<!-- TODO: Extend at least a bit -->

With the dashboard you will find a list of performed actions. This includes your and your teams operations. Seeing who did what when makes your work transparent and helps to increase security.

## People events

1. At 18:23, Liam, the junior developer, changes the PHP version of the website without verifying its functionality afterwards.
2. At 18:29, Sandra, the lead developer, receives a call from the client about the website being down. She logs in to the fortrabbit dashboard to identify the event that caused the website to break.

Liam will have to wait a little longer for their promotion.

## System events

The platform itself will also post updates on the event stream, like when a deployment ran, or when a [metric threshold](/collaboration/metric-events) is hit.
