With the dashboard you will find a list of performed actions. This includes your and your teams operations. Seeing who did what when makes your work transparent and helps to increase security. Event filters here allow you to narrow down your view only on certain type of events. On the events page in the dashboard you can see event filter options, as well as predefined event filters.

## Saved event filters

You can create your own event filters in the dashboard. Beside the actual filter settings, choose a name you can easily memorize. You can create a filter to output only metric issues, or a deployment log or billing related events. Saved event filters are stored with your account and are thus not shared.

## Exporting event filters

Saved event filters can also be send to a third party event stream service, such as Slack. This will allow the fortrabbit platform to post on a channel you will need to choose.
