## Understand individual access

An account on fortrabbit is a person, not an entity. It's common in classical hosting to have one account shared with a group of developers. Don't do that here, otherwise you may miss out on the collaboration features. Please sign up with `firstname.lastname@company.com` and not `accounts@company.com`. Learn more about [collaboration concepts](/1.platform/20.collaboration/1.intro.md).

## Account settings

The account settings are part of the person and refer to your user registration at fortrabbit. By signing up you create a personal account. This is how you login and use the services.

## Developers and clients

There are two types of people with the fortrabbit dashboard. You can choose your type when signing up and change it later on. A client is non technical person only managing to billing. A developer is a person with tech skills managing hosting, and maybe also billing. See [account types](/1.platform/20.collaboration/7.account-types.md) for more.

## Code access

Developers can add their public SSH keys for direct private code access. See the [SSH keys](/3.dev/15.learn/01.ssh-key-setup.md) section for more.

## GitHub app

To enable git deployment from GitHub, developers need to install the [fortrabbit GitHub app](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md) with their personal GitHub account.
