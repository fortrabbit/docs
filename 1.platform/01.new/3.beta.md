## Timing

We plan to transition to general availability after a few months of BETA testing. At the time of this writing, something between 3 and 9 months. There are a couple of features that we regard as important for full public release. We also plan to implement some customer feedback during BETA.

During the BETA time period - and beyond - the old platform will continue to run normally. [New and old platform will run side by side](/1.platform/01.new/4.new-and-old.md). There is no rush for existing customers. There will be extensive help and communication for the migration.

## Stability

We promise to do everything we can to keep your apps up and running. We offer a conservative **98% uptime SLA during BETA**, aiming for more. Monitoring is in place and we act as quickly as possible when something looks off.

- [fortrabbit.betteruptime.com](https://fortrabbit.betteruptime.com/) - status monitor including automated tests, covering the Alpha period as well

The platform is still under active development. We usually release once a week. New features are only deployed after automated checks and human testing.

- edge - local development
- staging - test environment
- production - where the BETA runs

During the [ALPHA period](/1.platform/01.new/2.alpha.md) we were able to catch many early issues. For the BETA, we want to gain more experience with larger real-world applications and run into all kinds of edge cases to harden the platform further.

## Terms

The [legal section](https://www.fortrabbit.com/legal) has been updated. The [new terms](https://www.fortrabbit.com/legal/terms) are applicable for new and old customers for the new and the old platform. There are only minor adjustments.

## Pricing

Expect to pay the prices you see. We plan to introduce final pricing and billing during the BETA. After all, we want to see if users would pay for what we are building.
