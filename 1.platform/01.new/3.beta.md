After months in [private ALPHA](/1.platform/01.new/2.alpha.md), the [new platform](/1.platform/01.new/1.intro.md) is now in public BETA. Many bugs have already been found and fixed. We are confident that it is now stable enough to host real world applications.

## Our goals of the BETA

- Gather more real-world feedback
- Harden the platform
- Catch some edge cases
- Complete missing features

## Benefits for you

- Experience a new features first
- Try new features landing soon
- Attractive pricing
- Expect good stability
- Enjoy the new design
- Enjoy the new docs

## Current limits

At the time of this writing the following features are still missing but planned to be added soon:

- Only one data center (EU) is available for now
- No real-time live updates in the dashboard yet
- Metrics are not yet implemented
- Autoscaling is not available yet
- Event log is not ready yet
- Streaming logs implementation will change, [see log usage](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md)
- Collaboration features are still a bit rough
- Many smaller features are not fully implemented

### Do

- **Deploy production websites**
- Find use cases we haven't thought about
- Uncover communication issues
- Create apps and environments
- Help hunting bugs
- Deploy code
- Route domains
- Change settings
- Test performance

### Feedback scope

- Product and pricing
- Feature scope and market positioning
- UI/UX/DX/design
- Communication
- General ideas
- Be direct and honest please

## Timing

We plan to transition to general availability after a few months of BETA testing. During that time - and beyond - the old platform will continue to run normally. [New and old will run side by side](/1.platform/01.new/4.new-and-old.md).

## Stability

We promise to do everything we can to keep your apps up and running. We offer a conservative 98% uptime SLA during BETA, aiming for more. Monitoring is in place and we act as quickly as possible when something looks off.

- [fortrabbit.betteruptime.com](https://fortrabbit.betteruptime.com/) - status monitor including automated tests, covering the Alpha period as well

The platform is still under active development. We usually release once a week. New features are only deployed after automated checks and human testing.

- edge - local development
- staging - test environment
- production - where the BETA runs

During the [ALPHA period](/1.platform/01.new/2.alpha.md) we were able to catch many early issues. For the BETA, we want to gain more experience with larger real-world applications and run into all kinds of edge cases to harden the platform further.

## Terms

The [legal section](https://www.fortrabbit.com/legal) has been updated. The [new terms](https://www.fortrabbit.com/legal/terms) are applicable for new and old customers for the new and the old platform.

## Pricing

Expect to pay the prices you see. We plan to introduce final pricing and billing during the BETA. After all, we want to see if users would pay for what we are building.
