## Limits during start of Beta

- Only one data center is available
- No real time live updates to dashboard
- Metrics are not yet implemented
- Autoscaling is not available yet
- Event log is not ready yet
- Many more features not fully implemented
- Steaming logs implementation will change, [see log usage](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md)

We hope to tackle many of these missing features during the beta phase.

## Known issues

- Collaboration features are rough
- Billing might not be finished

## Scope of testing

Go ahead and break things. We have done internal testing. But it's clear that no testing will stand actual usage.

- **Deploy production websites**
- Find use cases we haven't thought about
- Uncover communication issues
- Create apps and environments
- Help hunting bugs
- Deploy code
- Route domains
- Change settings
- Test performance

## Feedback

Thanks a lot for your interest and support. We are eager to see if we build a product that people will like.

- Product and pricing
- Feature scope and market positioning
- UI/UX/DX/design
- Communication
- General ideas
- Be direct and honest please

## Timing

We hope to transition to the general available after a couple of months beta testing. Beta testers will automatically transition to the final version.

## Terms

General terms are applicable.

## Pricing

Expect to pay for what is shown. We plan to introduce final pricing and billing during beta. After all we want to see if users would pay for that.
