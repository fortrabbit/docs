## Limits during start of Beta

- Only one data center is available
- No real time live updates to dashboard
- Metrics are not yet implemented
- Autoscaling is not available yet
- Event log is not ready yet
- Steaming logs implementation will change, [see log usage](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md)
- Many more small features not fully implemented

We hope to tackle many of these missing features during the beta phase.

## Known issues

- Collaboration features are rough

## Timing

We hope to transition to the general available after a couple of months beta testing. Beta testers will automatically transition to the final version.

## Liability

We promise to do everything we can to keep your apps up and running. We have extensive monitoring in place and act as quickly as possible when something looks off.

The platform is still under active development. We usually release once a week. New features are only deployed after automated checks and human testing. There are development, staging and production environments — the beta runs on production.

## Terms

General terms are applicable.

## Pricing

Expect to pay for what is shown. We plan to introduce final pricing and billing during beta. After all we want to see if users would pay for that.
