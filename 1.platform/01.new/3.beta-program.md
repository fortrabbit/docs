## Limits during start of Beta

- Only one data center is available
- No real time live updates to dashboard
- Metrics are not yet implemented
- Autoscaling is not available yet
- Event log is not ready yet
- Steaming logs implementation will change, [see log usage](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md)
- Many more small features not fully implemented

We hope to tackle many of these missing features during the beta phase.

## Known issues

- Collaboration features are rough

## Timing

We hope to transition to the general available after a couple of months beta testing. Beta testers will automatically transition to the final version.

## Terms

General terms are applicable.

## Pricing

Expect to pay for what is shown. We plan to introduce final pricing and billing during beta. After all we want to see if users would pay for that.
