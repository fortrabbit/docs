The new platform version is now live and open for everyone to use. Experience a redesigned fortrabbit. It will feel new, yet familiar. We have not imported old accounts. Create new accounts to get started. Use the same e-mail address as your old account so we can map it.

The legacy platform is also still open and fully functional and will receive full support. There is no rush and we aim to make the switch as seamless as possible. The legacy platform is going to be slowly phased out. Details and timing to follow. The access will stay the same.

## Migration

With general availability of the new platform, both new and old platform have feature parity. Customers can migrate their apps from old to new. We will support them as much as possible. We are even seeking to move Apps at the end of the transition period.

### Timing

By the time of this writing, it's not defined yet how long the old platform will exactly be supported. It depends on feedback and the needs of our customers.

- 2026?: Migration phase old &rarr; new
- 2027?: Switch off old platform

### Self-service migration

Early adaptors are welcome to already migrate their apps to the new platform. Recommended workflow overview using Git deployment:

1. Create a new app with the new platform
2. Add the fortrabbit GitHub app to your GitHub account
3. Create or map an existing repo at GitHub
4. Connect your local code base to the repo at GitHub
5. Push to deploy (again)
6. If required: Sync the database to the new app
7. If required: Sync the contents to the new app
8. Test functionality
9. Point your domain to the new DNS entries

### fortrabbit migration

After a couple of months we will migrate existing client apps from the old platform to the new platform. In most cases this will not require any interaction, but a maintenance with some downtime. We will inform you ahead.
