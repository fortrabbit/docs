**The old platform** is still open and fully functional and will receive full support and is only going to be slowly phased out. There is no rush to leave. We aim to make the migration as seamless as possible. Details and timing to follow.

**The new platform** is now live and open for everyone to use. Experience a redesigned new yet familiar fortrabbit. Use the same e-mail address as your old account so we can map it.
