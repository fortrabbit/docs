lead: With general availability of the new platform, both new and old platform have feature parity. Customers are invited to migrate their apps from old to new. We will support them as much as possible. We are then planning to migrate all Apps at the end of the transition period.

## Self-service migration

Early adaptors are already welcome to migrate their apps to the new platform. Recommended workflow overview using Git deployment:

1. Create a new app with the new platform
2. Add the fortrabbit GitHub app to your GitHub account
3. Create or map an existing repo at GitHub
4. Connect your local code base to the repo at GitHub
5. Push to deploy (again)
6. If required: Sync the database to the new app
7. If required: Sync the contents to the new app
8. Test functionality
9. Point your domain to the new DNS entries

Please :ContactUs{text="contact us"} at any point in the process. We are happy to help hands on. It's also possible to get a discount for the time of the migration.

## fortrabbit migration (planned)

After a couple of months we will migrate existing client apps from the old platform to the new platform. In most cases this will not require any interaction, but a maintenance with some downtime. We will inform you ahead.
