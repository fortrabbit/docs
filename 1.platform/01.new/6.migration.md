lead: With the new platform's general availability planned for 2026, we expect feature parity between the old and new systems. Customers are invited to migrate their apps at their convenience, with our full support. We plan to migrate all remaining apps automatically at the end of the transition period.

## Self-service migration

Early adopters are welcome to migrate their apps to the new platform. Here is a recommended workflow overview using Git deployment:

1. Create a new App on the new platform
2. Install the fortrabbit GitHub App on your GitHub account
3. Create a new repository or map an existing one on GitHub
4. Connect your local codebase to the GitHub repository
5. Push to deploy
6. Sync your database to the new App (if required)
7. Sync your content to the new App (if required)
8. Test functionality
9. Point your domain to the new DNS records

Please :ContactUs{text="contact us"} at any point during the process. We are happy to provide hands-on assistance. We can also offer a discount during the migration period.

## fortrabbit migration (planned)

In the future, we will plan to migrate remaining client apps from the old platform to the new one. In most cases, this will not require any action from you, though a maintenance window with some downtime may be necessary. We will inform you well in advance.
