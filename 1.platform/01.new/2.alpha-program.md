## Timing

We hope to transition to the Beta period after a couple of months testing with the ALPHA period. ALPHA testers will automatically transition to the beta period. The start of the beta phase will be announced upfront. See the [planned phases](1.intro.md#phases).

## Terms

The service is provided "as is" during this initial phase of real-world testing. [Existing policies](https://www.fortrabbit.com/policies) are applicable where possible.

- **Free to use during the ALPHA phase**
- Prices are displayed for reference and subject to change
- Uptime: Best effort, probably good

## Fair use

The service depends on finite resources shared amongst multiple customers. By using the ALPHA platform you agree not to use services excessively or unreasonably. Invite only a reasonable number of people.

## Apply

New users are gradually onboarded by invitation. Interested? Get on the list. Please include your use case and why you are interested.
