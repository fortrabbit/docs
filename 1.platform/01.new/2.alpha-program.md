## Limits during Alpha

- Only one data center is available
- No real time live updates to dashboard
- Metrics are not yet implemented
- Autoscaling is not available yet
- Event log is not ready yet
- Many more features not fully implemented
- Steaming logs implementation will change, [see log usage](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md)

## Known issues

- To deploy via GitHub it is recommended that all connected accounts have the fortrabbit GitHub installed. There is no UI for disconnecting the GitHub app currently.
- Collaboration features are rough

## Timing

We hope to transition to the Beta period after a couple of months testing with the Alpha period. Alpha testers will automatically transition to the beta period. The start of the beta phase will be announced upfront via email. See the [planned phases](1.intro.md#phases).

## Terms

The service is provided "as is" during this initial phase of real-world testing. [Existing policies](https://www.fortrabbit.com/policies) are applicable where possible.

- **Free to use during the Alpha phase**
- Prices are displayed for reference and subject to change
- Uptime: Best effort, probably good

## Fair use

The service depends on finite resources shared amongst multiple customers. By using the alpha platform you agree not to use services excessively or unreasonably. Invite only a reasonable number of people.

## Apply

New users are gradually onboarded by invitation. Interested? Get on the list. Please include your use case and why you are interested.
