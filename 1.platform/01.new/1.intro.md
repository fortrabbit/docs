## Why new?

fortrabbit provides hosting for almost two decades. The current fortrabbit platform was established in 2013. The new platform version was developed over several years. Everything was redesigned and rebuilt. This is our most advanced developer-centric PHP hosting solution.

## Feedback please

Thanks a lot for your interest and support. We are eager to see if we build a product that people will like. Go ahead and break things. We have done internal testing. But it's clear that no testing will stand actual usage.

## Migration

The current platform will be maintained for another while, both platform will run side by side. See [new and old - side by side](5.new-and-old.md).
