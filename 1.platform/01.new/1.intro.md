## Why new?

fortrabbit provides hosting for almost two decades. The current fortrabbit platform was established in 2013.

The new platform version of our hosting platform, developed over several years. Everything was redesigned and rebuilt, delivering an enhanced yet intuitive experience. This is our most advanced developer-centric PHP hosting solution, incorporating GitHub integration for automated deployments and streamlined multi-environment staging.

## Feedback please

Thanks a lot for your interest and support. We are eager to see if we build a product that people will like. Go ahead and break things. We have done internal testing. But it's clear that no testing will stand actual usage.

### Do

- **Deploy production websites**
- Find use cases we haven't thought about
- Uncover communication issues
- Create apps and environments
- Help hunting bugs
- Deploy code
- Route domains
- Change settings
- Test performance

### Feedback scope

- Product and pricing
- Feature scope and market positioning
- UI/UX/DX/design
- Communication
- General ideas
- Be direct and honest please

## Migration

The current platform will be maintained for another while, both platform will run side by side. See [new and old - side by side](5.new-and-old.md).
