fortrabbit hosting INC was established in 2013. We are pleased to introduce the latest version of our hosting platform, developed over several years and currently in its final refinement stages. We have redesigned and rebuilt all platform aspects, delivering an enhanced yet intuitive experience. This represents our most advanced developer-centric PHP hosting solution, incorporating GitHub integration for automated deployments and streamlined multi-environment staging.

## Release phases

| Phase                               |    SLA | Pricing |      Status |
| ----------------------------------- | -----: | ------: | ----------: |
| [Private alpha](2.alpha-program.md) |   ~80% |    free |     **Now** |
| [Open beta](3.beta-program.md)      |   ~98% |    paid |     Soonish |
| Public release                      | 99.99% |    paid | Near future |

### Scope of testing for alpha and beta

Go ahead and break things. We have done internal testing. But it's clear that no testing will stand actual usage.

- **Deploy production websites**
- Find use cases we haven't thought about
- Uncover communication issues
- Create apps and environments
- Help hunting bugs
- Deploy code
- Route domains
- Change settings
- Test performance

### Feedback

Thanks a lot for your interest and support. We are eager to see if we build a product that people will like.

- Product and pricing
- Feature scope and market positioning
- UI/UX/DX/design
- Communication
- General ideas
- Be direct and honest please

## Migration

The current platform will be maintained for another while, both platform will run side by side. See [new and old - side by side](5.new-and-old.md).
