## What to expect

A new, even more developer-friendly PHP hosting, featuring GitHub integration for automatic deployments and seamless multi-staging. Existing users may consult [changes](/0.new-platform/3.changes.md) to the current platform. We plan to gradually roll out the new platform during 2025. Exact timing to be defined and communicated.

## Phases

| Phase          |    SLA | Pricing |         Status |
| -------------- | -----: | ------: | -------------: |
| Private alpha  |   ~80% |    free |        **Now** |
| Open beta      |   ~98% |    paid | Coming soonish |
| Public release | 99.99% |    paid |         Future |

## Private alpha

The first phase is for a closed group of with limited functionality. More details [here](2.alpha-program.md).

## Open beta

More stable, mostly feature-complete and paid.

## Public release

The public release will follow the beta phase, with all initial features fully implemented and stable.

## Migration

The current platform will be maintained for another while, both platform will run side by side. We plan to help existing clients to migrate over to the new platform, hands on. Details to be defined, but at best, we will be able to migrate most applications.
