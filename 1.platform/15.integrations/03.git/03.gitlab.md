::CallOut{alert}
At the time of writing, there is no native fortrabbit GitLab app. This article describes how to set up a manual integration using GitLab CI/CD. Ping us with your requirements or something is not working out here.
::

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a popular tool that provides a Git-repository manager with wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features. You can use GitLab CI/CD to deploy your code to fortrabbit. This involves creating a pipeline that syncs your code to the fortrabbit App using rsync.

## Prerequisites

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**: You need a dedicated SSH key pair for the pipeline. Generate one locally (e.g. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f gitlab_deploy_key -C "GitLab CI"`).
2. **Add to fortrabbit**: Copy the **Public Key** (`gitlab_deploy_key.pub`) and add it as a **Deploy Key** in the fortrabbit Dashboard for your App.
3. **Add to GitLab**: Copy the **Private Key** (`gitlab_deploy_key`) and add it to your GitLab project's CI/CD variables (**Settings > CI/CD > Variables**) as `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

## Example workflow

Create or update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your repository. The following code is UNTESTED:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  only:
    - main
  script:
    - apk add --no-cache rsync openssh-client
    # Setup SSH agent
    - eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    - echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" | tr -d '\r' | ssh-add -
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    
    # Add fortrabbit to known hosts (replace region if necessary)
    - ssh-keyscan -H ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    
    # Sync to fortrabbit
    - rsync -av --delete ./ {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app:
```
