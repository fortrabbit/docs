::CallOut{alert}
Thanks for visiting. Laravel Nightwatch is currently not supported. Let us know if you want it. We need signal.
::

Current state: Laravel Nightwatch is under consideration. The daemon process shall run on a [worker job](/1.platform/09.components/07.jobs.md). But per requirement that process needs to be reached from the outside, which currently is not possible.
