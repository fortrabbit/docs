## About New Relic

[New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com) is a suite of professional software analysis tools. It offers analytics and deep insights on your Apps' performance and possible bottle necks. New Relic integrates as a PHP extension, which is installed (but not enabled) on all fortrabbit Apps.

## Usage

fortrabbit has a Bring-Your-Own-License integration with New Relic. That basically means: you need an account over at New Relic. Then you only need to paste the license key in our dashboard.

### Over at New Relic

1. Sign up or log in to [New Relic](https://newrelic.com).
1. Add a new application
1. Copy the license key

### At fortrabbit

1. Log in to the dashboard
1. Navigate to your environment > settings > New Relic
1. Paste the New Relic license key
1. Save

You are all good! After 5 minutes you should start to see data in your NewRelic dashboard. To get more information about how to use NewRelic, head to their [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm).
