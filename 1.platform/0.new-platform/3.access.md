## Early access program

We are slowly rolling out the new platform. Early adaptors can already test the new version.

## New platform URLs

The new platform version is now live and open for everyone to use. Experience a redesigned fortrabbit. It will feel new, yet familiar.

## Legacy platform URLs

The legacy platform is also still open and fully functional and will receive full support. There is no rush and we aim to make the switch as seamless as possible. The legacy platform is going to be slowly phased out. Details and timing to follow. The access will stay the same:
