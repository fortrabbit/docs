Per default all the [domains](/1.platform/10.objects/10.domain.md) of the environment will route to the same root path (sometimes this is also called: document root, docroot or root folder): `htdocs`. This path is where the first `index.php` will be called, when people are visiting your App on any domain. This path setting can vary, depending on what the framework or CMS you have selected in the software chooser when creating the app.

You can however set the root path afterwards at any given time by tinkering with [.htaccess](/3.dev/21.htaccess/2.redirects.md) to enable per domain routing.

## Plain default

In a typical old school PHP project, the root path is on top level and contains the `index.php` file, which is the default script to be executed.

```raw
www <-- Root path
├── index.php  <-- file to be called
├── css/
├── js/
├── images/
├── includes/
```

- **`index.php`**: Main entry point
- **`includes/`**: PHP scripts included

## Modern root path settings

For a better file structure and increased security, it is recommended to keep most PHP files outside the publicly accessible directory and use a folder as the document root:

```raw
www
├── public/ <-- Root path
│   └── index.php <-- file to be called
├── src/
├── vendor/
└── composer.json
```

- **`public/`**: Public-facing files
- **`src/`**: PHP source code
- **`vendor/`**: Composer dependencies

By configuring the `public/` directory, you prevent direct web access to sensitive files in `src/` and `vendor/`. This pattern is standard for all modern PHP frameworks and CMS:

- `public` - Laravel, Statamic, October CMS …
- `web` - Craft CMS …

## Root path setting on fortrabbit

On fortrabbit you can set the root path for each environment with the routing settings in the dashboard. When choosing a [software template](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md) the correct root path will pre-configured.
