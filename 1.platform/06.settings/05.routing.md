## Test domain

Each [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md) has a unique public test domain assigned that is constructed like `{{app-env-id}}.frbit.app`. Use it during development, testing or [multi staging](/3.dev/15.learn/03.staging-environments.md). Look up the actual name for your test domain with the dashboard under the environment overview.

## External domains

You can register your environment to accept requests from any external custom domain you route to fortrabbit — see also [the domain article](/1.platform/10.objects/10.domain.md). To set up a domain routing, you add a new custom domain within your App's domain settings in the dashboard.

## Main domain

Each environment has a main domain. It is exposed as a routing setting with the environment of the dashboard. The thumbnail preview shown with the dashboard uses the main domain as the source. It's also used for internal monitoring services. There is also a dynamic [ENV var](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md/2.usage.md) that maps to the currently configured value.
