::CallOut{alert}
Log usage is subject to change. For now an intermediate solution is offered. The output format and kind of access will change.
::

## Tailing logs

1. Login by SSH to the environment
2. Run `frbit-tail-logs` to see live log streaming

This will provide you a stream of logs.

## Log files in your CMS or framework

Mind that your CMS or framework might pipe logs to a different location, other than `stderr` and `stdout`. If they do, you will not see the error output in the fortrabbit dashboard. You can still access the logs by [SSH](/1.platform/04.code-access/03.ssh.md) or [SFTP](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md), please see your CMS / framework docs where the logs are stored.

Most CMS and frameworks also offer options to send these logs to the standard locations. With the [software template](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md) the setting is getting pre-populated, if possible, by ENV var.

### Verbose logging

Your CMS / framework might offer verbose logging, often this is connected to environment settings of the CMS / framework. Often more debugging information is printed with the error and sometimes errors are even send to the browser. Use that with care, since it can have a considerable performance impact. The general advice is to use it for development and staging environments, but not for production. If you happen to have an issue in production that requires verbose logging, turn it off, after you have finished.
