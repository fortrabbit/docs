[Environments](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md) ship with an opinionated pre-configuration of PHP settings. The dashboard exposes a couple settings to configure the PHP version and certain PHP extensions.

- Use [phpinfo](/3.dev/15.learn/10.php-info.md) to dump all the PHP settings.
- Use [user.ini](/3.dev/20.how-to/userini.md) for more fine grained control over PHP settings.
