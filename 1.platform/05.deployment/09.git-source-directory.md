# lead: A setting to define which folder from the repo to deploy.
---

The Git source directory is a dashboard settings for environments that have git deployment enabled. Define which folder with the Git repo should be deployed. In most cases the root path of the repo will work fine. Leave the field empty for that.

## Use cases

The most common use case is when you have a mono repo that holds multiple websites on one Git repo. For this scenario you can choose to deploy only a sub folder of the root directory, for instance `/apps/website-1`.
