Deploy hooks are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests to trigger a [deployment](/1.platform/10.objects/11.deployment.md) on an [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md).

## Settings

Deploy hooks are configured in the fortrabbit dashboard for each environment.

:BlockLink{title="Deploy hook settings for {{app-env-id}}" path="/environments/{{app-env-id}}/deployment#deploy-hook"}

After enabling a deploy hook, a unique URL is shown. Store it securely and use it to trigger deployments from external services.

## Trigger

To trigger a deployment, send a POST request to the deploy hook URL. No authentication or payload is required:

```bash
# Trigger
curl -X POST https://api.fortrabbit.com/v1/deploy-hook/LONGSTRING

# Get
curl https://api.fortrabbit.com/v1/deploy-hook//LONGSTRING
```

Upon successful trigger, the server responds with a deployment object:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "id": "dp_abc123",
    "state": "PENDING",
    "createdAt": 1676567890000
  }
}
```

## Use cases

- Deploy on CMS publish events via webhooks (Contentful, Strapi).
- Scheduled deployments with cron or workflow tools.
- Manual trigger from the CLI with a simple script or alias.
- Automation in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Zapier.

## Alternatives

The deploy hook is a specific solution for specific workflows. For most day to day usage. The [GitHub integration](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md) with automatic `git push` to deploy is the most convenient way to deploy.

## Security

**Deploy hooks are public!** Anyone with the URL can trigger a deployment. Each deploy hook URL contains a unique identifier. Treat this URL with the same security care as you would a password or API token. If you believe your deploy hook URL has been compromised, you can revoke it from the dashboard and create a new one. Consider rotating it on regular basis.

## Troubleshooting

If a deploy hook fails to trigger a deployment:

- **Invalid URL**: Verify the hook URL is correct and has not been modified
- **Revoked hook**: Check if the hook was revoked or deleted from the dashboard
- **Network issues**: Ensure the external service can reach the fortrabbit deployment API
- **Check status**: View deployment history in the dashboard to confirm if the hook was triggered

You can monitor all deploy hook triggers and their results in the deployment history of your environment.
