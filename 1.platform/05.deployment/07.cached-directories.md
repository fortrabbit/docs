## How it works

During most deployments the [build commands](/1.platform/05.deployment/3.build-commands.md) will include something like `composer install` or `npm install`. These processes will download dependencies and populate the `vendor` and the `node_modules` folders. The cached directories defines folder to be preserved and re-used without downloading all dependencies with each deployment. Thus first deployment may take a couple of minutes, but successive deployments will be much faster.

Note that this is a setting that happens on the deploy service, not on the environment, see the [deployment intro](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md).

## Default settings

```plain
vendor
node_modules
```

In most cases the default setting is what you want. To disable cached directories, save an empty value.

## Purging cached directories

It can be helpful to purge the cached directories. Purging the cached directories, as the title suggests, will delete all files and folders, so next time during deployment a new cache will be created.

There is a button with the dashboard to purge the cache. Saving the cached directories will also purge the cache.
