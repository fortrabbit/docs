## Get ready

Before starting to troubleshoot deployment issues, specifically if you are setting up things for the first time, make sure to have everything configured correctly:

- New to Git? Read the [git intro](/3.dev/15.learn/git-intro.md) first
- Read the [deployment intro](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md)
- Have the [fortrabbit GitHub app](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md) installed with GitHub
- Have an environment connected to a repo at GitHub

## GitHub connectivity errors

You can NOT push to GitHub? You may see an error in the command line when trying to push or no changes arrive with the repo at GitHub.

- [GitHub: Troubleshooting connectivity problems](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/troubleshooting-connectivity-problems)

## Transit errors

You can push to GitHub, the new deployment does not arrive with fortrabbit environment. There is no deployment at fortrabbit.

- Do you have an account at fortrabbit and one on GitHub?
- Make sure to have the [fortrabbit GitHub App](/1.platform/05.deployment/2.github-app.md) installed and connected
- Are you deploying to the branch that is connected?
- How did you set up automatic deployment with fortrabbit?

## Deployment errors

Everything above is set up correctly, there are deployments with fortrabbit, but they fail.

- Check the [deploy logs](/1.platform/05.deployment/17.logs.md) to see the error
