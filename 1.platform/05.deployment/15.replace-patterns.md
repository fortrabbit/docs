This is essential to avoid old files cluttering the system and confusing the software. This setting is only available when the [deployment strategy](/1.platform/05.deployment/7.strategy.md) is set to 'merge'. Note that with the blend strategy, all files from the deployment build will synced into the content of the actual web storage. No old files will be deleted.

For certain folders, it's better to delete their content.

Sensible defaults based on [software templates](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md) are provided. Rsync syntax is supported.

Rsync syntax is supported, allowing regex like patterns. The asterisk `*` serves as a wildcard.

## Examples

```yml
## Craft CMS
/config/project

## Pattern to replace all JPGs
*.jpg
```

When the [deployment strategy](/1.platform/05.deployment/7.strategy.md) is set to replace, there is an opposite setting to define [exclude patterns](/1.platform/05.deployment/9.exclude-patterns.md).
