## Code example

```plain
{{app-name}} - name of the currently selected app.
{{app-env-name}} - name of currently selected environment.
{{app-env-id}} - ID of the currently selected environment.
```

- Logged can use the select on the right to change the values
- Unknown users will see the variables in curly braces `{{variable}}`

## Deep links

:BlockLink{title="Change plans for {{app-env-name}}" path="/environments/{{app-env-id}}/components"}

- Logged in users see a link
- Unknown users see on info to login to see the link

## How to use

See a select on the left side of docs (desktop version). With that select, the most recently used environment is selected. Change the select to a different environment to show different examples.

## How it works

The login state of the [dashboard](/1.platform/02.concepts/30.dashboard.md) is stored in a functional cookie, along with a list of environments. It will change appropriate code examples on the current page according to the selected environment. Clearing browser cookie will reset the state.
