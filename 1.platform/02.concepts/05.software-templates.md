## How it works

When connecting a Git repo from GitHub while setting up an app, the code in the repo will be scanned using the [stack detector](https://github.com/fortrabbit/stack-detector). It will discover the software and version.

Based on that, a fixed set of hosting settings, the software templates, can be applied.

In addition to the general software templates `composer.json` and `package.json` will be parsed to suggest custom [build](/3.dev/03.deployment/03.build-commands.md) and [post-deploy commands](/3.dev/03.deployment/04.post-deploy-commands.md).

- `npm run build` will be set when a `package.json` is present
- `composer install` will be set when a `composer.json` is present

## What it does in detail

- Book matching [components](/1.platform/09.components/)
- Set a matching PHP version
- Enable PHP extensions
- Suggest build and post deploy commands
- Apply desired [root path](/1.platform/02.concepts/root-path.md) — to serve from the right location
- Populate [ENV vars](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md/1.intro.md) — to connect to the database automatically

This is especially handy with modern software that supports [ENV var](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md/2.usage.md) configuration and environment detection — like [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel) or [Craft CMS](/2.guides/3.craft-cms) do.

## What it does not do

The software template will **NOT install** the selected software on your behalf. Installing software with composer is easy. We expect you to have a local development running before. In many cases developers bring existing projects.
