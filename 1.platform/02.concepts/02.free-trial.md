## Trial time limit

There is a 72h time limit for the trial. A countdown timer in the dashboard with the app will show you the time left. We may experiment with different timing options.

## Extend trial time

:ContactUs{text="Request more trial time"} with support to extend trial time. Write something about your goals and why you need more time. In most cases, we are happy to extend your trial time. This needs to be done ahead of trial end.

## Trial end

When setting an app in trial mode you can define what shall happen when the trial period ends:
