Jobs are an optional component, see [booking and scaling jobs](/1.platform/09.components/07.jobs.md). After booking a new settings page will become available with the environment in the dashboard. Here you can add, remove, start, stop and edit jobs.

## Job settings

- **Status**: active/disabled
- **Job name**: A unique name, identifier
- **Command**: The command to run, [see below](#command-settings)
- **Job type**: Cron or worker
- **Exit signal**: Graceful shutdown - default is usually fine
- **Exit timeout**: Time to forceful kill when graceful shutdown is not responding

When choosing the type cron these additional settings become available:

- **Interval**: How and when the job should run, see [crontab help](/1.platform/18.jobs/02.crons.md#crontab-schedule-reference)
- **Max runtime**: How long the job is allowed to run

### Command settings

You need to call a command or script via the runtime. To call a PHP task you need to prefix it with `php`. To call a shell script you need to prefix it with `bash`:

- `php artisan queue:listen -v`
- `bash path/to/my-script.sh`

## Job types

- [Workers](/1.platform/18.jobs/03.workers.md): Non-stop running in the background, event driven triggers
- [Crons](/1.platform/18.jobs/02.crons.md): Scheduled at certain times
