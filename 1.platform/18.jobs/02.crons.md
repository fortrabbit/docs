## About crons

A cron job is a scheduled task in Linux that automates executing software, typically shell scripts or executables. They allow you to schedule tasks, such as running scripts or commands, to occur automatically at specific times or intervals. The fortrabbit platform offers some additional abstraction. Crons are available with the [jobs component](/1.platform/9.components/7.jobs.md) and managed through the dashboard, see [job usage](/18.jobs/01.usage.md). The job component runs in an isolated container, so that frontend and backend processes are separated.

### Cron use cases

- Publish a scheduled story
- Periodic email sending
- Read and parse RSS feeds
- Collect and analyze data
- Generate reports
- Run database optimizations
- Update contents
- Clear caches

Cron jobs are entries in the cron table (crontab), each containing a schedule and a command to execute. The cron daemon (crond) reads the crontab to determine which jobs to run and when to run them.

## Crons in PHP today

Crons are common and have been around for a long time in the PHP world. You can call any PHP script as a cron at a specified time or interval. Having the cron script in PHP gives you the benefit of version controlling the logic of the job to run. Modern PHP frameworks, such as [Laravel](/software/laravel) and [Symfony](/software/symfony) have added their own scheduling components and logic with advanced features. They offer additional abstraction so developers don't need to deal with nitty gritty.

- Laravel: `artisan schedule:run`, see [Laravel queuing](/2.guides/2.laravel/3.tune.md#queueing)
