## About workers

A worker job is a long running task that is executing software, scripts or executables. The fortrabbit platform offers some additional abstraction. Workers are available with the [jobs component](/1.platform/9.components/7.jobs.md) and managed through the dashboard, see [job usage](/18.jobs/01.usage.md). The job component runs in an isolated container, so that frontend and backend processes are separated.

### Worker jobs use cases

- Image processing
- API communication
- Meta data aggregation

## Advanced usage

See [job tuning](/18.jobs/05.tuning.md).
