## Use cases

SFTP is commonly used by novice developers to upload code. It's not a good practice but get's the job done. We recommend to deploy code via Git or sync using rsync. Sometimes it's a helpful companion tool to look up something quickly.

* **Browse files**: Check what's actually on the server.
* **See logs**: Analyze access or error logs.
* **Upload assets**: If you have large binary files not suitable for Git (though Object Storage is usually better).
* **Troubleshooting**: Quick fixes or inspecting generated files.

## SFTP access details

```raw
Host:       ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app
User name:  {{app-env-id}}
Password:   No password required, private SSH used
Protocol:   SFTP (not FTP)
Port:       22
```

## SFTP clients

There are various SFTP clients out there. Check our [SFTP clients section](/4.integrations/08.sftp-clients/01.intro.md).

## SFTP is not FTP

SFTP is short for SSH File Transfer Protocol. It is used for uploading and downloading files over a SSH connection. Despite the similar name, SFTP is very different than FTP or FTPS internally, but for most practical purposes they are very similar. SFTP is preferable to FTP because the the transferred data is encrypted and not visible to everyone on the network.

## SFTP command line interface

The `sftp` command line tool is available on most Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux.

```bash
# Connect to your environment via SFTP
sftp {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app

# Example: Upload a file
put /path/to/local/file.txt /path/to/remote/file.txt

# Example: Download a file
get /path/to/remote/file.txt /path/to/local/file.txt
```

## Alternatives

Consider using more modern alternatives to SFTP, such as:

* [Git deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) - advanced code deployment
* [SSH](/1.platform/04.code-access/03.ssh.md) - interactive terminal access
* [rsync](/3.dev/20.how-to/rsync.md) - repeatable file transfer
