## Use cases

SFTP is commonly used by novice developers to upload code. Sometimes it's helpful to look up something quickly. It's not a good practice but get's the job done.

## SFTP access details

```raw
Host:       ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app
User name:  {{app-env-id}}
Password:   No password required, private SSH used
Protocol:   SFTP (not FTP)
Port:       22
```

## SFTP clients

There are various SFTP clients out there. We recommend [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) (on Mac and Windows). Modern editors and IDEs have support for SFTP, including VS Code, Sublime, PhpStorm, Notepad++ and so on.

## SFTP is not FTP

SFTP is short for SSH File Transfer Protocol. It is used for uploading and downloading files over a SSH connection. Despite the similar name, SFTP is very different than FTP or FTPS internally, but for most practical purposes they are very similar. SFTP is preferable to FTP because the the transferred data is encrypted and not visible to everyone on the network.

## SFTP command line interface

The `sftp` command line tool is available on most Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux.

```bash
# Connect to your environment via SFTP
sftp {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app

# Example: Upload a file
put /path/to/local/file.txt /path/to/remote/file.txt

# Example: Download a file
get /path/to/remote/file.txt /path/to/local/file.txt
```

## Alternatives

Consider using more modern alternatives to SFTP, such as:

- [Git deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md) - advanced code deployment
- [SSH](/1.platform/04.code-access/03.ssh.md) - interactive terminal access
- [rsync](/3.dev/20.how-to/rsync.md) - repeatable file transfer
