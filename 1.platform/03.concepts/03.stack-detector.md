When connecting a Git repo from GitHub while setting up an app for [git deployment](/1.platform/05.deployment/01.intro.md), the code in the repo will be scanned using the stack detector:

- [github.com/fortrabbit/stack-detector](https://github.com/fortrabbit/stack-detector) - open source

It will discover the used software packages and versions. Matching settings from the [software templates](/1.platform/03.concepts/05.software-templates.md) will be applied. In addition `composer.json` and `package.json` will be parsed to suggest custom [build commands](/1.platform/05.deployment/03.build-commands.md):

- `npm run build` will be set when a `package.json` is present
- `composer install` will be set when a `composer.json` is present
