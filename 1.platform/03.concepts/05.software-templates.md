We maintain a list of hosting settings for popular software to be pre-configured for smooth setup. When setting up an app with [Git deployment](/3.dev/03.deployment/02.github-app.md) the repos will be parsed by the [stack detector](/1.platform/03.concepts/03.stack-detector.md) and the software will be detected automatically. If the software is not detected or setup without Git deployment is preferred, the software can be chosen by the user. Software templates are version aware (although just major versions).

- Book matching [components](/1.platform/09.components/)
- Enable PHP extensions
- Apply desired [root path](/1.platform/02.concepts/root-path.md) — to serve from the right location
- Populate [ENV vars](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md/1.intro.md) — to connect to the database automatically
- Suggest [post deploy commands](/1.platform/05.deployment/04.post-deploy-commands.md)

This is especially handy with modern software that supports [ENV var](/3.dev/19.env-vars/1.intro.md/2.usage.md) configuration and environment detection — like [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel) or [Craft CMS](/2.guides/3.craft-cms) do.

## What it does not do

The software template will **NOT install** the selected software on your behalf. Installing software with composer is easy. We expect you to have a local development running before. In many cases developers bring existing projects.
