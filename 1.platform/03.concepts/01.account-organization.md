## One account at fortrabbit is preferred

No need to create an account and share credentials with colleagues or clients. A fortrabbit account maps to a person in real life. In fact, the account settings are just part of the [person object](/1.platform/10.objects/03.person.md).

With a single account, you can create multiple [apps](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md), create and join multiple [teams](/1.platform/10.objects/04.team.md), and work with multiple [payment methods](/1.platform/10.objects/09.payment-method.md). Invite other developers to collaborate on code or clients to manage billing.

This maps to the way GitHub is organized. At GitHub you can have your personal repos, contribute to other people's repos, and be part of multiple organizations. This aligns with how fortrabbit integrates with GitHub.

## How NOT to handle one account

* Share one account with multiple people - [Collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/1.intro.md) rules!

## Why NOT have multiple fortrabbit accounts

* New account for each app - You can have multiple apps, with [individual billing](/1.platform/20.collaboration/3.billing-collaboration.md)
* New account to start a new trial app - Each new app starts as a new trial
* New account for each client - [Client collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/3.billing-collaboration.md) is much better
* Creating an account for your agency - [Developer collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/2.developer-collaboration.md) is much better

## Why have multiple fortrabbit accounts

### Strict separation

Collaboration features are designed to be open and transparent. Collaborators can see your other apps, payment methods, and teams on your profile. They can see names and metadata, but cannot access them. Often that is desired; this way you can request access to an app that you need to work on as well.

If you don't want to expose any of your other projects to your co-workers, create a second private account at fortrabbit.

### You have multiple GitHub accounts

When you have two accounts at GitHub, maybe one for work and a private one, you may also want to keep that separation with fortrabbit.

## GitHub connection limits

The connection between a fortrabbit account and a GitHub account is 1:1. That means:

* You can't connect the same GitHub account to multiple accounts at fortrabbit
* You can't connect multiple GitHub accounts to one account at fortrabbit
