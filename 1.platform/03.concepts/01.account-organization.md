## Best use one account only

A fortrabbit account maps to a person in real life. People manage [apps](/1.platform/10.objects/01.app.md), [teams](/1.platform/10.objects/04.team.md), and [payment methods](/1.platform/10.objects/09.payment-method.md).

| Person      | Team                  | App               | Payment method        |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| human being | a group of developers | website / web app | an object owning apps |
| active      | passive               | passive           | passive               |

### How NOT to handle one account

* **No account sharing please** - No need to create an account and share credentials with colleagues or clients. Use [collaboration features](/1.platform/20.collaboration/1.intro.md).
* **No generic accounts please** - Please sign up with `firstname.lastname@company.com` and not `accounts@company.com`.

## Why to have multiple fortrabbit accounts

In some scenarios it might be advisable to have multiple accounts at fortrabbit as one individual:

### Strict separation

Collaboration features are designed to be open and transparent. Collaborators can see your other apps, payment methods, and teams on your profile. They can see names and metadata, but cannot access them. Often that is desired; this way you can request access to an app that you need to work on as well.

If you don't want to expose any of your other projects to your co-workers, create a second private account at fortrabbit.

### Multiple GitHub accounts

At GitHub you can also use one Account to manage personal repos, contribute to other people's repos, and be part of multiple organizations. But when you have multiple accounts at GitHub, maybe one for work and a private one, you may also want to keep that separation with fortrabbit.

### GitHub connection limits

The connection between a fortrabbit account and a GitHub account is 1:1. That means:

* You can't connect the same GitHub account to multiple accounts at fortrabbit
* You can't connect multiple GitHub accounts to one account at fortrabbit

### How NOT to handle multiple accounts

* **New account for each app** - NO! You can have multiple apps
* **New account for new trial** - NO! Each new app starts as a new trial
* **New account for each client** - NO! Use [client collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/3.billing-collaboration.md)
* **New account for organization** - NO! Use [developer collaboration](/1.platform/20.collaboration/2.developer-collaboration.md)
