There are no one-click installers at fortrabbit. Our software guides are mostly about deploying and configuring an existing code base to fortrabbit. Our friendly support chat can help you with all general hosting questions as well as wth general PHP questions. Additionally we are good with certain frameworks and CMS. We have categorized our knowledge in levels.
