## Intro

With VPS hosting you pay for size of your box. Within that box you can run different services. fortrabbit on the other side has a micro service oriented architecture with services running in isolated containers. This architecture is reflected in the pricing. A component represents a service that can be booked and scaled individually per [environment](/1.platform/10.objects/02.environment.md).

PHP, database, but also traffic and storage are components. Most components are available in different sizes, those are called plans and are titled like t-shirt labels: XS, S, M, L …. Different resource attributes are associated with the plans as well.

| **Component** | **Attribute** | **Plan** | **Price** |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------: | --------: |
| PHP           | XXX MB        |       XS |        $X |
| Database      | XXX MB        |       MD |        $X |

See the [components list](/1.platform/09.components/index.md) for all available components. The [pricing page](https://www.fortrabbit.com/pricing) gives you an overview. The [pricing intro](/1.platform/12.billing/01.pricing-structure.md) explains level billing concepts.
