The following commands are run on your local computer. The `mysql` command line client is required. Exact commands may differ depending on the kind of [local development environment](/4.integrations/01.local-development/01.intro.md).

```shell
# 1. Create a tunnel in a dedicated terminal window
ssh -N -L 13306:mysql:3306 {{app-env-id}}@ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app
# This will have no output. That's Ok. Open a new window
```

```shell
# 2. In a new window connect to the database
$ mysql -u {{app-env-id}} -h127.0.0.1 -P13306 -p -D {{app-env-id}}
# In the next step you will be asked for your MySQL password.
```

- [Database download via terminal](/1.platform/08.mysql/02.export-import/09.database-down-terminal.md)

## Port setting

Port local 13306 is just an example, any port in the range 1025-65535 can be used. The remote port 3306 must be 3306.
This command is not supposed to print a confirmation message. If nothing shows up: you did it right!

## Troubleshooting

- The most common issue is to expect output with the tunnel command. No response is good. Open a new terminal window and continue.
- The second most common issue is to expect output with the tunnel command. No response is good. Open a new terminal window and continue.
- The third most common issue is to expect output with the tunnel command. No response is good. Open a new terminal window and continue.
- It's `127.0.0.1` not `localhost`.
