## Get ready

Database import/export is a crucial task for managing multiple environments. The standard use case is to sync the state of a remote environment with a local environment. For that it requires:

- Have a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) running.
- Be able to [access the remote fortrabbit](/3.dev/08.mysql/db-access-intro.md) database.

MySQL doesn't support incremental updates, so you'll always export the complete database structure and contents. This involves creating a `dump.sql` file from the source database and importing it to the destination database. The process works in both directions:

- **Upload**: Export from local and import to fortrabbit
- **Download**: Export from fortrabbit and import to local

During initial setup, you'll typically import your local database to fortrabbit at least once. Later, as content is added with the production environment, sync changes back to the local environment periodically.

Using `mysqldump` and `mysql` is the standard approach to migrate data between MySQL servers from the command line.

## Next

Depending on your local development environment setup and preferences, certain commands may differ.

- [Database access via terminal from local](/3.dev/08.mysql/01.access/02.db-access-local-terminal.md)
  - [Database up via terminal](/3.dev/08.mysql/02.export-import/08.database-up-terminal.md)
  - [Database down via terminal](/3.dev/08.mysql/02.export-import/09.database-down-terminal.md)
- [Database access via GUI from local](/3.dev/08.mysql/01.access/03.db-access-local-gui.md)
  - [Database up via GUI](/3.dev/08.mysql/02.export-import/10.database-up-gui.md)
  - [Database down via GUI](/3.dev/08.mysql/02.export-import/11.database-down-gui.md)
