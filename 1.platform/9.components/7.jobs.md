Jobs is an optional [component](/11.concepts/components.md) that can be booked and scaled per [app environment](/10.objects/2.app-environment.md) in the [dashboard](/11.concepts/dashboard.md). The scaling increases in available RAM and number of jobs.

```raw
┌─────────┐                        ┌───────────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ visitor │ ◀─ Request/response ─▶ │  app environment  │ ◀──▶ │ worker/cron │
└─────────┘                        └───────────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

Jobs run in a separate runtime container with access to the app environment's file system and [database](/9.components/2.database.md). They are deferred from the front-end web layer to a background process that operates outside the web request/response life-cycle. This ensures that web requests are delivered swiftly, even when heavy processing is happening in the background. Environment variables and settings are kept in sync.

## Scaling

The available job plans differ in available memory and the number of jobs, that can be booked.

## Job types

Worker jobs and cron jobs are widely supported by modern PHP frameworks like [Laravel](/2.laravel/) and [Symfony](/5.guides/8.symfony.md), as well as CMS systems like [Craft CMS](/craft-cms) and [Statamic](/statamic).

- [Workers](/18.jobs/03.workers.md): Non-stop running in the background, event driven triggers
- [Crons](/18.jobs/02.crons.md): Scheduled at certain times
