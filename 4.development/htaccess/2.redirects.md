## Redirect all requests to https

**Force https!** There is no need for your application to be reached over a non-secure connection. Use `.htaccess` to redirect all `http://` requests over to `https://`. This is how:

```plain
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !=https
RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L,N]
```

**Order matters. This rule should be one of first rules, so right on top of your htaccess file** Please also note the X-Header part. Other code snippets you find elsewhere might not work here. This is because we are running our Apache behind a set of load-balancers. They are performing the HTTPS encryption and not Apache. Many CMS and frameworks are already offering convenient settings and configurations for this.

## Redirect all requests to the primary domain

Once you've added a [custom domain](/domains) you may want to prevent requests to your [App URL](/app#toc-app-url). The example below shows how to set up a domain based redirect in your `.htaccess` file.

```plain
# From App URL to your domain
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^.*\.frb\.io$ [NC]
RewriteRule .* https://www.your-domain.example%{REQUEST_URI} [r=301,L,N]
```

A CMS will have it's own options for that. If you don't use a redirect, make sure to at least set the "canonical URL" to be on your primary custom domain so that that search engines know that there is only one content.
