## Get ready

Make sure to have completed all steps from the [get ready guide](/2.craft/1.setup.md). You now should have Craft installed in your local development environment already, if not see [here](/2.craft/1.setup.md).

## About Craft Copy

Craft Copy is a command line tool to help you deploying Craft CMS from our local development environment to your fortrabbit App. It will take care of the code, the assets and the database.

## Installing and using Craft Copy

Please see the **[Craft Copy usage guide at GitHub](https://github.com/fortrabbit/craft-copy#requirements)**. It guides you through the process of installing the plugin, connecting your App, deploying code, assets and database.

## Alternative ways to deploy Craft CMS

Don't feel like using Craft Copy? No problem! Here are some alternative ways to deploy Craft on fortrabbit:

There is a more basic guide: [Install Craft using SFTP](/craft-upload-sftp).
Or if you prefer to use Git directly, check out our guide: [Deploy Craft CMS with Git](/craft-deploy-git)

### Assets management

Don't put the assets (uploads) in Git. Git is not made for binary files and it only works as a once way street. Deploy the Craft `assets` folder separately: [Deploy Craft CMS assets with rsync](/2.craft/4.assets.md)

### Database export / import

Please see our general [MySQL export/import guide](/9.mysql/export-import.md) for various ways to how to copy the database from local to remote and the other way around.
