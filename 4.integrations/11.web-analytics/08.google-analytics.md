## About Google Analytics

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) is a web analytics service from Google. The current version, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), uses an event-based data model.

## Privacy considerations

Google Analytics collects user data and uses cookies. In many jurisdictions, this requires explicit user consent through cookie consent banners. Consider using privacy-focused alternatives like Fathom or Plausible if GDPR compliance without consent banners is important to you. You should review Google's data processing terms and configure Analytics to comply with applicable privacy laws in your region.

## Pricing

Google Analytics is free for most websites. There is a paid version called Google Analytics 360 designed for enterprise customers with advanced needs.
