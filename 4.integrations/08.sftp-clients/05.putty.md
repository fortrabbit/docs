[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) is a classic command line tool for Windows users. PuTTY itself is for SSH terminal access, but the suite includes `PSFTP` for secure file transfers via command line. If you prefer a graphical interface on Windows, we recommend [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [Cyberduck](/4.integrations/08.sftp-clients/02.cyberduck.md).

We do not recommend using puTTY on Windows any more. Better use the command `ssh` as it is included Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), starting with Windows 10.
