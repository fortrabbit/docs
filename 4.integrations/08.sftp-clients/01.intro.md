You mostly deploy code via Git. However, SFTP is useful for browsing files, downloading logs, uploading assets, and troubleshooting. See our [SFTP guide](/1.platform/04.code-access/04.sftp.md) for connection details and use cases. There are many good clients available. We have guides for the most popular ones.

The older protocols FTP and FTPs are not support on fortrabbit, only the newer SFTP protocol is supported. All clients speak that too.

fortrabbit also does not support username/password authentication for SSH/SFTP. SSH keys need to be used, see [code access](/1.platform/04.code-access/01.intro.md).
