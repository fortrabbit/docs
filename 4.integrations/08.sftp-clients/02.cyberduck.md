[Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) is a popular, (free) open-source client that supports SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, and more. It is available for macOS and Windows. It has a cute icon, but might have become a bit bloated over the years.

## Setup

1. Open Cyberduck and click **Open Connection**.
2. Select **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)** from the dropdown.
3. **Server**: `ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app`
4. **Port**: `22`
5. **Username**: `{{app-env-id}}`
6. **SSH Private Key**: Select your private key file from the dropdown or browse for it.
7. Click **Connect**.

You can also save this as a bookmark for easier access later.
