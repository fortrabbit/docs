## GitHub

GitHub has first-class support. We offer a native [GitHub App](/1.platform/05.deployment/02.github-app.md) that integrates deeply with the platform. This is the recommended way to deploy with Git.

## Other providers

You can also use other Git providers like [GitLab](04.gitlab.md) or [Bitbucket](03.bitbucket.md). Since there is no native integration, you will need to set up a deployment pipeline using their respective CI/CD tools (GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines) to sync your code to fortrabbit.

Codeberg is under consideration too.
