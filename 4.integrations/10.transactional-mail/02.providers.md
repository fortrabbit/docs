Here are some commercial services for transactional emails. Sorry, we can't tell you which is the best one — haven't got the time to test them all. Well known are:

- [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses)
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) - see [article](/4.integrations/10.transactional-mail/03.postmark.md)
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) - see [article](/4.integrations/10.transactional-mail/04.sendgrid.md)
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com)
- [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com)
- [SendInBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com)

Not so well known but also available:

- [Doppler Relay](https://www.dopplerrelay.com/en)
- [Dyn email](https://dyn.com/email)
- [GrennArrow](https://www.drh.net)
- [Pepipost](https://pepipost.com)
- [Socketlabs](https://www.socketlabs.com)
- [Sparkpost](https://www.sparkpost.com).

Special mention goes top [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io) which is a service dedicated to bring you safe email testing with a fake SMTP server to test and view the mails your application is sending. We are using Postmark app ourselves but beside that we have no other business relation to any of the services mentioned here. No affiliate links.

## Self hosted

You can also host your own transactional email server. This gives you full control and data privacy, but comes with the responsibility of maintaining the server and — most importantly — managing IP reputation to ensure deliverability.

- [Postal](https://postal.atech.media/) - Open source mail delivery platform for incoming & outgoing e-mail.
