[TiDB](https://pingcap.com/en/product/tidb) (Titanium DB) is an open-source distributed SQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible.

## Compatibility

TiDB speaks the MySQL protocol. You can connect to it using standard MySQL clients and drivers.

## Configuration

Treat it like a standard MySQL connection in your application.

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=gateway01.eu-central-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com
DB_PORT=4000
DB_DATABASE=test
DB_USERNAME=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

Note that TiDB usually runs on port `4000` instead of `3306`.

## Region

TiDB Cloud is available on AWS. Select the region closest to **AWS eu-west-1** (Dublin).
