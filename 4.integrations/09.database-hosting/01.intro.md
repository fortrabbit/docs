fortrabbit provides an optional [MySQL component](/1.platform/09.components/02.mysql.md). Some applications require specialized database solutions. Keep your app on fortrabbit, disable the database component, and use an external database provider.

## Connecting to external databases

Since fortrabbit allows outgoing connections, you can connect to any external database service that is accessible over the internet.

1. **Provision**: Set up your database with the external provider.
2. **Credentials**: Get the hostname, username, password, and database name.
3. **Env Vars**: Store credentials in [environment variables](/3.dev/19.env-vars/index.md).

The standard MySQL port 3306 for making outgoing connections is open by default. If your external database uses a different port, open it up by using the [outgoing firewall setting](/1.platform/06.settings/21.firewall-outgoing.md).

## Latency considerations

When using an external database, the physical distance between your application (hosted on fortrabbit AWS eu-west-1) and your database matters. Always try to provision your external database in the same region (AWS eu-west-1 / Ireland) to minimize latency.
