[Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a serverless open-source Postgres database. It separates storage and compute to offer a modern serverless Postgres experience. It features branching, autoscaling, and bottomless storage.

## PHP and Postgres

While fortrabbit is currently offers a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), you can absolutely use Postgres if your application supports it.

### Extensions

You need to ensure the `pgsql` or `pdo_pgsql` extensions are enabled. On fortrabbit, these are available. You might need to enable them in your `composer.json` or just use them if they are standard. (Actually, `pdo_pgsql` is usually enabled by default on fortrabbit).

### Laravel example

Laravel supports Postgres out of the box. Just change your default connection:

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=ep-random-name-123456.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=neondb
DB_USERNAME=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

## Region

Neon runs on AWS. Choose a region that is close to your fortrabbit app.
