[CrateDB](https://crate.io/) is a distributed SQL database built on top of a NoSQL foundation.
It is a distributed SQL database that makes it easy to store and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time. It is good for IoT and time-series data. CrateDB uses the PostgreSQL wire protocol. So you can use many standard PostgreSQL clients and libraries to interact with it.

## Use Cases

CrateDB is often used alongside a primary relational database (like the one provided by fortrabbit) to handle high-volume ingest and analytical queries (OLAP), while the primary DB handles transactional workloads (OLTP).

## PHP Integration

You can use the `pdo_pgsql` driver to connect to CrateDB.

```php
$dsn = 'pgsql:host=crate-cluster.example.com;port=5432;user=crate;password=';
$pdo = new PDO($dsn);
```
