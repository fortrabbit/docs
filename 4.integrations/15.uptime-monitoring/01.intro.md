Uptime monitoring tools continuously request your websites, APIs, and critical endpoints from one or multiple regions. If checks fail, usually multiple times, they send alerts by email, SMS, or other channels you configure.

## Relation to web hosting

No platform-level integration with fortrabbit is required. Uptime tools work externally by checking your domains and endpoints.

This gives you an independent signal that does not come from the hosting provider. It can help reveal incidents where a provider does not meet its SLA.

From our support perspective, many outages are application-specific. They are often caused by code or configuration changes, and uptime checks alone may not reveal the root cause.

## Categories

Tools like Pingdom and PagerDuty helped define this category. The boundaries between monitoring categories are blurry now.

- Some uptime tools include status pages and incident communication.
- Some status page tools include other synthetic checks, like page speed.
- Some APM and observability suites include uptime checks as one feature among many.
- Some include on-call management capabilities.

There is no single "correct" setup. Choose a specialized uptime tool, combine multiple focused services, use one larger platform, or even run your own self-hosted tool.

Today, everything is AI-powered.

## What to evaluate

The market is crowded. Before choosing a provider, compare the practical details that affect daily operations:

1. Alert quality, escalation rules, and on-call integrations.
2. Check types: HTTP(S), keyword, API, SSL, heartbeat, cron, and port checks.
3. Global probe locations and check frequency.
4. Incident workflows and public or private status pages.
5. Integrations with your existing tooling (Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, webhooks).
6. Pricing model and included check volume relative to your budget.

Many tools have a freemium model, allowing to use it for a limited number of checks and websites.
