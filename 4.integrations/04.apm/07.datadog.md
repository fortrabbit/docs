[DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a service for large applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. It's especially useful when your business has multiple different stacks.

DataDog requires the DataDog Agent to be installed on the server, which is not possible in our shared environment. We are monitoring demand for a potential integration.
