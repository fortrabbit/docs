Tideways is currently not supported.

[Tideways](https://tideways.com/) is an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool specifically designed for PHP. It's from Germany, the makers are deeply rooted in the PHP scene. It helps developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their applications.

Tideways is currently under consideration. It requires a custom PHP extension and a daemon process, which are not part of our standard stack yet. We are monitoring demand for this integration.
