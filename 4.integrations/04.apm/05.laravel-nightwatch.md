::CallOut{alert}
Laravel Nightwatch is currently not supported.
::

Laravel Nightwatch is a new PHP profiling tool. It is part of the Laravel eco system and thus hyped a lot. The daemon process shall run on a [worker job](/1.platform/09.components/07.jobs.md). But per requirement that process needs to be reached from the outside, which currently is not possible.
