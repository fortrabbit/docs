[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an open-source APM and observability tool. It provides a unified UI for metrics, traces, and logs. It is native to OpenTelemetry.

SigNoz integration requires running the OpenTelemetry Collector and instrumenting your application. This is currently not supported on our platform. We are monitoring demand for this integration. Want it? Let us know!
