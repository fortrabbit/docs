APM tools help you look inside your running application to identify performance bottlenecks, slow database queries, and runtime errors. Instead of guessing why your app is slow, APM tools give you data-driven insights to optimize your code effectively.

fortrabbit hosting aims to provide you [actionable metrics](/1.platform/06.settings/30.metrics.md) to help you identifying issues without the need of an extra service. But professional APM tools are more than just server metrics. They can be essential.

## Relation to web analytics

APM tools focus on application and infrastructure performance, while [web analytics](/4.integrations/11.web-analytics) track user behavior and traffic patterns. Some modern APM tools like Sentry and PostHog include analytics features, providing error tracking, user insights and more in one platform. Consider using APM tools for sophisticated backend monitoring and web analytics for simple user interactions.
