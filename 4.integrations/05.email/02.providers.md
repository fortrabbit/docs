## Email account provider types

There are roughly two paths to host email accounts with your own domain:

- Classical web-hosting packages often include domain registration and e-mail services. Some [domain providers](/4.integrations/02.dns/01.intro.md) also offer email accounts.
- A dedicated email service may has advanced features such as office integration, team management, a more fancy mail client, backups …

## Considerations

- Privacy and security
- GEO location
- Pricing
