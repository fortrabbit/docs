## Prerequisite

Have a look at our [git intro](/3.dev/15.learn/git-intro.md) if that is new to you.

## Options to use Git

- **Terminal**: Fast, scriptable, universal. Great for standard commands.
- **GUI**: Visual, discoverable. Great for reviewing diffs, resolving merge conflicts, browsing commit history, squashing commits.
- **IDE**: Integrated, close, good for daily tasks, also PRs.

## IDEs with Git support

Most modern code editors come with excellent Git integration out of the box.

- **VS Code**: Has a built-in Source Control tab. Great for staging changes and handling merge conflicts inline.
- **PhpStorm**: Features a very powerful Git GUI. The "Local History" feature is a life saver.

## Git integration at fortrabbit

The fortrabbit platform does not offer a git repo. You connect to a GitHub repo with a Git client.
