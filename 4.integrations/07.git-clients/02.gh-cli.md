[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) brings GitHub to your terminal with the `gh` command. It reduces context switching between browser and terminal. It is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux for free.

```bash
# Install it with brew on macOS
$ brew install gh
```

## Difference to Git

`git` is the version control system. You use it to track changes, commit code, and sync with a remote repository - [see git intro](/3.dev/15.learn/git-intro.md).
`gh` is the GitHub CLI. You use it to interact with GitHub features that are not part of Git itself, like Pull Requests, Issues, and Releases. Think of it this way:

- **git**: `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`, `checkout`
- **gh**: `pr create`, `issue list`, `release create`, `repo view`

## Create a repo and connect it to GitHub

Here is an example on how to use `git` to create a local repo and `gh` to create and connect a remote repo at GitHub. This will also push the content right away.

```bash
# Initialize a new git repository
git init

# Add files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Init"

# Create a new public repository on GitHub from the current directory
gh repo create --public --source=. --push
# Follow the steps

# Once this is done, just push like this
git push
```

## More examples

```bash
# Create a pull request from your current branch
$ gh pr create

# Checkout a pull request locally
$ gh pr checkout 123

# List open issues assigned to you
$ gh issue list --assignee "@me"

# View a specific issue in the browser
$ gh issue view 123 --web

# Clone a repository
$ gh repo clone fortrabbit/docs

# Open the current repository in your browser
$ gh browse
```
