[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is NOT a Git client. It brings GitHub to your terminal, think GitHub TUI. It reduces context switching between browser and terminal. You can manage pull requests, issues, releases and more directly from the command line. It is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux for free. It's used in install guide examples here.

```bash
# Install it with brew on macOS
$ brew install gh
```

## Difference to Git

`git` is the version control system. You use it to track changes, commit code, and sync with a remote repository.
`gh` is the GitHub CLI. You use it to interact with GitHub features that are not part of Git itself, like Pull Requests, Issues, and Releases. Think of it this way:

* **git**: `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`, `checkout`
* **gh**: `pr create`, `issue list`, `release create`, `repo view`

## Examples

```bash
# Create a pull request from your current branch
$ gh pr create
 
# Checkout a pull request locally
$ gh pr checkout 123

# List open issues assigned to you
$ gh issue list --assignee "@me"

# View a specific issue in the browser
$ gh issue view 123 --web

# Clone a repository
$ gh repo clone fortrabbit/docs

# Open the current repository in your browser
$ gh browse
```
