[Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is a fast and friendly Git client for Mac and Windows and has gained popularity for being extremely fast and having a clean, intuitive interface. It offers a generous free evaluation version (almost free). It's a very good tool for individuals. It's also good as a companion app, when using Git in the terminal or through IDE integration.
