Laravel Herd provides a streamlined local development environment specifically optimized for PHP applications on macOS and Windows. It bundles NGNIX, DnsMasq and some other magic to an easy to use statusbar app. For using MySQL the Pro upgrade must be bought.

- [herd.laravel.com](https://herd.laravel.com)

Laravel Herd is newer than [Laravel Valet](/4.integrations/01.local-development/03.laravel-valet.md) and [Laravel Sail](/4.integrations/01.local-development/05.laravel-sail.md).

## Installation and usage

Download the installer from the official website and run it. Herd runs in your menu bar. It automatically creates a `~/Herd` directory. Any folder you put in there will be automatically served as a `.test` domain. For example:

1. Create `~/Herd/my-project`
2. Open `http://my-project.test` in your browser

You can switch PHP versions for individual sites or globally directly from the Herd menu bar icon.

The free version of Herd does not include database management.

## Working with fortrabbit

Herd uses your system's SSH keys, so interacting with fortrabbit git repositories works out of the box if your keys are set up correctly in `~/.ssh`.
