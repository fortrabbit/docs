Sail is Laravel's own take on a Docker-based local development environment. It's essentially a `docker-compose.yml` file and a CLI wrapper script stored in your project. It's a good match if you want a per-project isolated environment that matches the "Laravel way" of doing things.

- [laravel.com/docs/sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail)

## Installation

It comes pre-installed with new Laravel projects. For existing ones:

```bash
composer require laravel/sail --dev
php artisan sail:install
```

## Usage

It's just Docker under the hood. You use the `sail` command to interact with it.

```bash
# Start the environment
./vendor/bin/sail up

# Run artisan commands
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

# Run composer
./vendor/bin/sail composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

**Tip:** Configure a [shell alias](https://laravel.com/docs/sail#configuring-a-shell-alias) so you can just type `sail` instead of `./vendor/bin/sail`.

## Comparison

Unlike [Valet](/4.integrations/01.local-development/03.laravel-valet.md) or [Herd](/4.integrations/01.local-development/04.laravel-herd.md), Sail runs everything in containers. This means no pollution of your local machine, but it also means it's a bit heavier on resources (Docker Desktop required).

## Working with fortrabbit

Sail is for local development. When you deploy to fortrabbit, you are pushing your code, not the Docker containers. The platform handles the runtime environment for you.
