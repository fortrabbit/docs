Laravel Valet is an easy-to-use local solution not only for Laravel developers on macOS. It's a command line interface, so you install it with the Terminal. It bundles NGNIX, DnsMasq and some other magic to an easy to use CLI.

- [laravel.com/docs/valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet)

## Installation

It's best installed with Homebrew and it requires PHP and Composer.

```bash
# Install Valet via Composer
composer global require laravel/valet
```

## Examples

```bash
# Run the installer
valet install

# Park: Register a directory for all your projects
cd ~/Sites
valet park
# Now ~/Sites/my-project is available at http://my-project.test
# The `park` command registers a directory on your machine that contains your applications. All directories within that directory will be accessible in your web browser at `http://<directory-name>.test`.

# Link: Serve a single site
cd ~/path/to/project
valet link
# Now available at http://project.test
# The `link` command is useful if you want to serve a single site in a directory and not the entire directory.

# Secure: Serve over HTTPS
valet secure my-project
# You can serve your sites over encrypted TLS using HTTP/2 with the `secure` command.

# PHP Versions: Switch globally or per site
valet use php@8.5
cd ~/Sites/legacy-project
valet isolate php@7.4
```

## Database

Valet does not include a database management tool.

## Working with fortrabbit

Since Valet runs directly on your host machine, it uses your local SSH keys by default.

## Graphical interface

- [phpmon.app](https://phpmon.app/) - a nice UI for Valet
