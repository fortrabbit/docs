**We can not recommend DDEV enough.** It is an abstraction layer on top of Docker to simplify local PHP development. It's rooted in the Drupal world but is also popular with [Craft CMS](/2.guides/3.craft-cms/01.install.md), [Symfony](/2.guides/7.more/08.symfony.md), [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel/01.install.md) and [WordPress](/2.guides/6.wordpress/01.setup.md). DDEV is sponsorware, use it for free to use, donations welcome. It's a command line tool and has many nice features and even plugins.

## Installation

DDEV runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It requires a Docker provider to be installed first. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is the standard, [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) (macOS) is a lightweight alternative.

```bash
# Install DDEV is via Homebrew (macOS)
brew install ddev/ddev/ddev

# One-time initialization for local HTTPS
mkcert -install
```

For Windows or other installation methods, please refer to the [official DDEV installation docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/).

## Example usage

```bash
# 1. Initialize
# Navigate to your project's root directory and run:
ddev config
# This wizard will ask you a few questions about your project.

# 2. Start
# Spin up the containers:
ddev start

# 3. Develop
# See project details:
ddev describe

# Open project in browser:
ddev launch

# Access the container's shell:
ddev ssh
```

## SSH Keys

To deploy code or sync data with fortrabbit from within the DDEV container, your local SSH keys need to be available. Run this command once per session:

```bash
ddev auth ssh
```
