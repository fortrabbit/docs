ServBay is a GUI-based local development environment for macOS and Windows. It provides web servers, multiple PHP versions, and common databases in one app, with per-project settings and local DNS.

Freemium: There is a usable free tier, as well as Pro and Team plans (billed yearly).

## Installation

Download the installer for your operating system, then launch the app. ServBay runs as a desktop application and manages services from its UI.

## Example usage

1. Create a new website in ServBay.
2. Choose a project folder and a local domain.
3. Select the PHP version for that project.
4. Start the web server and open the local URL in your browser.

## Database

ServBay can run local databases from the same UI. Choose a database service, start it, and connect with your app using the local host and port shown in ServBay.

## Working with fortrabbit

ServBay runs on your machine, so it uses your local SSH keys. If your keys are configured in `~/.ssh`, you can interact with fortrabbit git repositories as usual.
