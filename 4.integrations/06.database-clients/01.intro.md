We recommend using a local database client (GUI) over web-based tools like phpMyAdmin.

* **Secure:** Connections are made over SSH tunnels, keeping your data safe.
* **Fast:** Native applications are generally faster and more responsive than web interfaces.
* **Productive:** Features like auto-completion, visual query builders, and history help you write queries faster and with fewer errors.
* **Versatile:** You can manage your local development database and your remote production database in the same application, often side-by-side.
