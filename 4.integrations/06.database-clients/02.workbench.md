[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is the official unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. It provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools.

It's free to use and is popular among Windows users. We don't have much first hand experience setting it up.

## Connection setup

To connect to your fortrabbit database, you need to set up a **Standard TCP/IP over SSH** connection.

1. Open MySQL Workbench and click the **+** icon to add a new connection.
2. **Connection Name**: Give it a name (e.g., `My App`).
3. **Connection Method**: Select `Standard TCP/IP over SSH`.
4. **SSH Hostname**: `ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app`
5. **SSH Username**: `{{app-env-id}}`
6. **SSH Key File**: Browse and select your local private SSH key (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
7. **MySQL Hostname**: `mysql` (Do not use localhost or an IP address).
8. **MySQL Server Port**: `3306`
9. **Username**: `{{app-env-id}}`
10. **Password**: Click **Store in Keychain** and enter your database password from the Dashboard.
11. **Default Schema**: `{{app-env-id}}`

Click **Test Connection** to verify everything is working, then **OK** to save.
