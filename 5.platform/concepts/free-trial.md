## Extending the trial time

## Upgrading the trial

You can, of course, upgrade from your trial to a paid plan at any time. You can do so under your App's overview.

## The end of a trial

When setting an app in trial mode you can define what shall happen when the trial period ends:

- opt-in: the trial app will be deleted at the end, upgrade any time before
- opt-out: the trial app will be upgraded to paid after the trial ends, cancel any time before
