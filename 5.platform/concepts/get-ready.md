## Create an app

We assume you've already created an [app](/app) with fortrabbit. If not: Do so in the [fortrabbit dashboard](/dashboard).

### Choose your software

While creating the app we are showing you a list of popular frameworks and CMS, this is called the [software preset](/software-preset). Choose the one you want, or any PHP App. That will pre-configure the fortrabbit App, but not install any software. You can change that later on.

## Run a local web server with PHP

You have a PHP development environment with Apache, MySQL, PHP and Git setup and running on your local machine, haven't you? This is crucial, we advice to have a local development environment for all kind of projects. All install guides are written with a local development environment in mind. Find more details on how to do that in our [local development guide](/local-development).
