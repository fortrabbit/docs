To start a conversation, open the chat bubble on the bottom right corner. Signed-in users are automatically registered and can submit new tickets and view history on previously opened tickets.

Our support is driven by Intercom (external service). The AI will try answer your question based on these docs and previous support cases, if that doesn't help, a human will pick up.

Sometimes human support is live chat. At other times we will come back on you as soon as possible. We will always answer.
