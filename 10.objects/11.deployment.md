From the [dashboard](/11.concepts/dashboard.md) point of view, a deployment is an event documenting the transfer of files from a git repo to the [environment](/10.objects/2.app-environment.md). The deployment shows you all kind of meta data including logs of the deployment, the issuer, the environment and a link to the deployed commit.

Deployments are only recorded for git deployments using the [official fortrabbit GitHub app](/6.deployment/2.github-app.md). Deployments via GitHub actions are not recorded. SSH/SFTP sessions are also not considered deployments. With the Git settings of an environment you can control the rules for deployment. Please proceed to the [deployment section](/6.deployment/) to learn more.
