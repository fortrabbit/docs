From the [dashboard](/11.concepts/dashboard.md) point of view, a deployment is an event documenting the transfer of files from a Git repo to the [environment](/10.objects/2.app-environment.md). The deployment displays various metadata, including deployment logs, the issuer, the environment, and a link to the deployed commit.

Deployments are recorded only for Git deployments using the [official fortrabbit GitHub app](/6.deployment/2.github-app.md). Deployments via GitHub actions are not recorded. SSH/SFTP sessions are not considered deployments either. With the Git settings of an environment you can control the rules for deployment. Please proceed to the [deployment section](/6.deployment/) to learn more.
