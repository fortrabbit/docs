## About domains on fortrabbit

Please note that fortrabbit does not provide domain registration services. An "external domain" is a domain registered with a third party service.

Each fortrabbit app-environment has its own, unique environment URL for testing purposes. Additionally you can "route" any number of external domains to your App. Essentially that means that you can host a PHP application under a dedicated domain name on fortrabbit, that you have registered with a third party domain name registrar.

### 1. Tell fortrabbit about your domain

1. Click New > "Add a new domain" and follow the steps
2. Choose a domain name and an environment
3. After saving, keep the window open for the DNS settings

### 2 Point the domain to fortrabbit with your DNS provider

Use the provided DNS information from the fortrabbit dashboard to change the domain routing with your domain provider.

* Change the A Record to use the provided IP
* Leave any other records untouched, especially MX
* Remove any AAAA records

Save the settings with your domain provider and wait a while. The while depends on the TTL settings of the DNS records, or usually up to 6h.
