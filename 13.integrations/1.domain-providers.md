## About domain registration

Domain registration is the process of acquiring a web address for a website - a Top Level Domain. To do this, you need to go through a domain registrar, which will check availability and let you purchase the domain, usually for a year in advance. Once registered, you can link the domain to your fortrabbit app environments by setting appropriate DNS records. See the [domain article](/10.objects/10.domain.md).

With classical shared and VPS hosting, domain registration and e-mail hosting were often bundled in packages. Today you can find dedicated services. There are various offerings, so you should consider upfront what you'll need. We look at:

1. Additional IMAP/POP3 e-mail accounts - see [email providers](/13.integrations/2.email-providers.md)
2. Specialized in advanced DNS configurations
3. Exotic TLD-endings
4. General domain forwarding with HTTPS
5. Support for forwards with ALIAS or ANAME records

Many of our clients are using classical offerings combining domain ordering and e-mail hosting. Others are using separate services for domain registration and e-mail hosting, there are also dedicated services that only offer DNS.

## Domain service providers

It's common to choose a local domain registration provider, since they sometimes offer better rates for your country TLDs and will provide pricing in your currency.

- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) - US, popular classical hosting with e-mail
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) - US, DDOS protection, no e-mail, see our [integration guide](/13.integrations/cloudflare.md)
- [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) - US, domains and DNS if you have an AWS account anyhow
- [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) - NZ
- [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/) - US, dedicated DNS service provider, no domain registration

We have not business relation with any of these providers and these are not affiliate links.
