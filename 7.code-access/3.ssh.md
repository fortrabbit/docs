## Get ready

- You need to have setup [SSH keys](/15.tips/ssh-keys.md) to authenticate.
- See the direct [code access intro](/7.code-access/1.intro.md) for uses cases and limits.

## Accessing SSH

Each [app environment](/10.objects/2.app-environment.md) has it's own SSH access. Execute the following in your terminal to login:

```shell
# Connect to your app environment via SSH
$ ssh {{ssh-user}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com
```

If the login went well, you will see a small welcome message:

```raw
–––––––––––––––––––––––  ∙ƒ  –––––––––––––––––––––––
```

## Executing PHP scripts

If you want to execute PHP scripts, including `artisan` and it's like, make sure to specify the PHP interpreter explicitly:

```shell
# will work
$ php artisan some:command
$ php some-script.php

# will _not_ work:
$ ./artisan some:command
$ ./some-script.php
```

## Using Composer

Using [Git deployment](/6.deployment/1.intro.md) will trigger [Composer](/15.tips/2.composer.md) automatically. Therefore, it should not be necessary to run Composer from the App environment. If you still need to run Composer manually on the App, you can. Please think twice before using `composer update`, because that will bring your local code out of sync which is likely to cause issues. Use `composer install` instead. Again, running Composer directly on the App is probably not what you want to do.

## Limitations

- This is not a root shell, so you can't install or remove software packages
- Mind that you are using the same runtime as your web application: resource intensive operations will drain memory and CPU from the web execution
- [Worker and cron jobs](/9.components/7.jobs.md) are managed via the dashboard, not the shell
