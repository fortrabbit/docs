## Use cases

It is also possible to [deploy with Git](2.git.md) here and also use [SSH](/ssh-uni). It is not recommended to mix the different deployment methods. Please see our [deployment methods article](deployment-methods-uni) to learn how the different ways to deploy code work side by side.

## SFTP clients

There are various SFTP clients out there. We recommend [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (on Mac and Windows). Modern editors and IDEs have support for SFTP, including Sublime, PhpStorm, Notepad++ and so on. In a hurry, you can use `sftp` from a terminal which should be installed if `ssh` is installed.

## SFTP is not FTP

SFTP is short for SSH File Transfer Protocol. It is used for uploading and downloading files over a SSH connection. Despite the similar name, SFTP is very different than FTP or FTPS internally, but for most practical purposes they are very similar. SFTP is preferable to FTP because the the transferred data is encrypted and not visible to everyone on the network.
