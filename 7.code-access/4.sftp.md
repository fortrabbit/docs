## Use cases

It is also possible to [deploy with Git](/6.deployment/1.intro.md) here and also use [SSH](/7.code-access/3.ssh.md) to access files. SFTP is often used by less experienced developers.

## SFTP access details

```raw
Host:       deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com
User name:  {{ssh-user}}
Password:   No password required, your private SSH key will be used
Protocol:   SFTP (not FTP)
Port:       22
```

## SFTP clients

There are various SFTP clients out there. We recommend [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (on Mac and Windows). Modern editors and IDEs have support for SFTP, including VS Code, Sublime, PhpStorm, Notepad++ and so on. In a hurry, you can use `sftp` from a terminal which should be installed if `ssh` is installed.

## SFTP is not FTP

SFTP is short for SSH File Transfer Protocol. It is used for uploading and downloading files over a SSH connection. Despite the similar name, SFTP is very different than FTP or FTPS internally, but for most practical purposes they are very similar. SFTP is preferable to FTP because the the transferred data is encrypted and not visible to everyone on the network.
