## Personal code access

TODO!

## Shared code access in teams

You manage your code access with your personal account on fortrabbit. This way you always have up-to-date code access on each app you have access on. It also makes managing the team easy — add/remove collaborators and code access is handled "automagically".

## Direct code access methods

1. [SSH](/ssh) — advanced tasks and deployment
2. [SFTP](/sftp) — legacy upload style


## Choosing a workflow

You can mix deployment methods, but not interchange the different deployment methods. Choose your main deployment method upfront.

Use the workflow that matches your skills and the requirements of the software you are using. In general we advice to work with Git, as it is: faster, more secure, it also includes an additional code backup with rollback and — with fortrabbit — Composer is also already integrated.

## Mixing deployment methods

It's not black and white either. When working with Git, you often will use some SSH/SFTP in addition — to deploy generated assets and manage user uploads for example.
