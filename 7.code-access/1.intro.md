## About direct code access

We recommend to use [Git deployment](/6.deployment/1.intro.md) as it includes build steps and works best in teams.

### As alternative to git deployment

Some developers don't know 

### As addition to git deployment



## SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol to login to remote web servers. SSH is used in the terminal. It's pre-installed with most operating systems. With SSH you login to have an interactive session on the remote server - the [app environment](/13.objects/2.app-environment.md) in our case. SSH is not suited for transferring files from your computer to the server. Use [rsync](/18.tips/rsync.md), to upload your website. See the [SSH guide](/7.code-access/3.ssh.md) for more details.

## SFTP

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol to transfer files to and from web servers. It's build on top of SSH. You will usually use it with a graphical interface. See the [SFTP guide](/7.code-access/4.sftp.md).

## SSH key authentication

To access code by either method, SSH keys are required. Upload your public SSH keys to your personal account with the dashboard. Read [more about SSH keys here](/18.tips/ssh-keys.md).

Your code access credentials are stored with your personal account on fortrabbit. This way you always have up-to-date code access on each app environment you have access on. It also makes managing the team easy — add/remove collaborators and code access is handled "automagically".
