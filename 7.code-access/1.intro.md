## SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol to login to remote web servers. SSH is used in the terminal. It's pre-installed with all operating systems. With SSH you login to have an interactive session on the remote server - the [app environment](/13.platform/2.objects/2.environment.md) in our case. SSH is not suited for transferring files from your computer to the server. See the [SSH guide](/7.code-access/3.ssh.md) to get started.

## SFTP

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol to transfer files to and from web servers. It's build on top of SSH. You will usually use it with a graphical interface. See the [SFTP guide](/7.code-access/4.sftp.md) to get started.

## Code access is not deployment

You can use SFTP or SSH (with [rsync](/12.dev-tips/7.rsync.md)) to upload your website. For most cases we recommend to use a Git based deployment system. Use the workflow that matches your skills and the requirements of the software you are using. Git deployment is faster, more secure, it also includes build steps and additional code backup.

It's not black and white either. When working with Git, you often will use some SSH/SFTP in addition — to deploy generated assets and manage user uploads for example.

See our [deployment intro](/6.deployment/1.intro.md) to get started.

## Shared code access in teams

You manage your code access with your personal account on fortrabbit. This way you always have up-to-date code access on each app you have access on. It also makes managing the team easy — add/remove collaborators and code access is handled "automagically".
