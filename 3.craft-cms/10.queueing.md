Craft CMS uses queue jobs for long-running tasks. By default these jobs are processed by a web based ajax call which blocks PHP processes that are meant for site delivery. In the worst case scenario the queue runner consumes all PHP resources. Luckily there are more robust solutions available.

## Workers

Run long running processes in a isolated environment without hurting site delivery with the [workers component](/9.components/7.workers.md).

1. Set up a job with this Craft command: `php craft queue/listen -v`
2. Remove `runQueueAutomatically` from `config/general.php` to disable the standard queue

## Async Queue plugin

For most queue workloads the `ostark/craft-async-queue` plugin mitigates the problems described above. There is no further configuration required, just install it like any other plugin. See the [guide on Github](https://github.com/ostark/craft-async-queue) to understand what it does. Consider it a poor mans worker.
