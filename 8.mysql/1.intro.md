## About MySQL

MySQL is part why PHP is so popular. It's the M in the LAMP stack. Most classical CMS systems, such as [WordPress](/5.guides/5.wordpress.md) and [Craft CMS](/3.craft/1.setup.md) are using it as the central data storage. Alternatives to MySQL are PostgreSQL and [Redis](/9.components/8.redis.md).

## MySQL on fortrabbit

On fortrabbit it is integrated as an optional component, available in different plans. Please see the [MySQL component options](/9.components/2.mysql.md) for more. The dashboard displays various metrics on MySQL as well as providing access details.
