## No silver bullets

A common misconception is that a powerful web server alone will make a website run fast. 'Buy a fast server' is naive and wrong advice, we think.

While we provide scalable hosting services, it's important to understand that simply adding more hosting power won't necessarily improve performance. Effective performance requires understanding and coding skills. You, the web developer, have most responsibility when it comes to website performance. Good code can fly.

## Not all websites are alike

Your milage may vary. For some websites or individual pages, an execution time of 500 ms might be acceptable, while for others it might not be. Individually built websites have unique performance patterns as well. We support a wide range of different applications using software systems such as Laravel, Symfony, Craft CMS, WordPress and many more.
