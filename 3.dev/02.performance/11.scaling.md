The fortrabbit platform offers a high grade of abstraction for booking required hosting resources, aiming to make booking more resources an almost seamless experience. The product catalog is designed in [components](/1.platform/09.components/index.md) that can be booked and scaled individually.

Finding the optimal plan for an website depends on many factors and is the responsibility of the web developer. There are quite a few factors that come into play.

## Scaling and performance

- Components like Jobs and Key-value store can reduce load on other components
- Increasing traffic can affect resource requirements of other components
- Code and config has a huge impact on performance

## Tips

- Turn on [autoscaling](/1.platform/12.billing/11.autoscaling.md)
- Start small, scale later
- Monitor performance
- Review and refactor code before scaling resources
- Book smaller plans for staging environments
- Book higher plans for production environments
