## Daily drama

Support requests from customers complaining about server errors asking us to fix it (immediately) are our daily reality.

:Quote{text="My site has crashed. Please fix ASAP!"}

We get it. The website may suddenly return a [504 server error](/3.dev/22.http-errors/504.md). That looks like something is odd with the hosting. Maybe nobody touched the code for months, it has been running like this for months. Now suddenly an issue pops up. Then suddenly an issue appears, causing confusion, shame and strong emotions.

Our job is to explain that this is typically not an infrastructure problem, but an application issue. In most cases, we can help clients identify what's causing their problems. This can be a delicate situation. Sometimes business owners contact us after their web developer told them to do so. We then ask them to contact their developer again so the developer can work with us directly.

## Responsibility

We run the infrastructure. You are responsible for the code you write and deploy. That's essentially what our terms of service state. We believe it's important to separate responsibilities clearly – there need to be clear, distinctive rules.

This separation can be challenging. We often work with freelancers and website creators who excel at creating good designs, managing clients, and configuring content management systems. However, performance optimization requires deeper insights into underlying technical processes. Performance should never be treated as an afterthought.

We aim to help us much as we can. Case by case.
