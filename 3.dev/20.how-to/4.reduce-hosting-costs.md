## Use the costs overview

With our dashboard under each of your [payment methods](/1.platform/10.objects/09.payment-method.md) you can find an invoice archive. There is also an invoice draft for the currently ongoing costs for the month so far. The [pro-rated daily billing](/1.platform/12.billing/02.postpaid.md) helps you to remove unnecessary [components](/1.platform/02.concepts/03.components.md) with immediate effect.

## Review apps and environments

See if you have any unnecessary [apps](/1.platform/10.objects/1.app.md) or [environments](/1.platform/10.objects/02.app-environment.md) hanging around — maybe some out-of-date side project, or something half finished? Delete! Make sure you have an up-to-date and complete local backup. That way, you can easily re-deploy it again at a later stage.

## Check component plans

Review your currently selected [components](/1.platform/02.concepts/03.components.md). Compare with visitors. You can experiment with a lower scaling of PHP and MySQL. Keep an eye on PHP requests and performance.
