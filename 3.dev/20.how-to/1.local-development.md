## Why

We anticipate that you'll be running a local development. The fortrabbit platform aims to make deployment from the local development to remote easy after all. It has many benefits.

- See code changes in real time.
- Test your code before deploying.
- Maintain an up-to-date backup of your code.

Not having a local development environment can lead to all kind of problems. Developers break their production app while doing open heart surgery running major updates on the remote server.

## Local PHP development requirements

The following open source software should run in your local development environment to match with the fortrabbit platform:

- **Apache** or NGNIX — a web server
- **MySQL** - the database if you make use of one
- **PHP** - the server side scripting language
- **Git** - the version control - [see git](/3.dev/15.learn/git-intro.md)
- **Composer** - the dependency manager for PHP - [see composer intro](/3.dev/15.learn/2.composer.md)
- **Node.js** and NPM - for frontend build processes

## How

There are various ways to set up your local development stack, depending on your skills, needs, and operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Luckily with Composer driven PHP development it's usually enough to roughly match the remote environment. Specifically major and minor PHP versions should be kpt im sync. Choose the approach that best suits you.

### Local development in virtual boxes

Utilizing a virtualization for development allows you better replication of your local setup across a team. Also having everything stashed into a virtual machine very much nullifies any interference with your local host system. It keeps things clean. A project with a containerized local development environment can also be frozen to the software specific versions used at that time. There are two primary virtualization approaches for development:

**Container virtualization** is the modern way. It's often a bit harder to setup, but once done easier to use and is very economical in terms of resource usage. [Docker](http://www.docker.org) is the goto tool. **We recommend to use [DDEV](https://ddev.com)** as an abstraction layer on top of Docker to simplify local PHP development.

**Desktop virtualization** is the classical way. It's easier to setup for novice users, but eats up more resources. Example VM applications are: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)(free by Oracle) or [VMware](http://www.vmware.com)(paid). VirtualBox controlled by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) helps a lot when setting up reproducible development environments. [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead#main-content), which builds upon Vagrant is popular with Laravel.

### Local development on your host machine

You can run a web server and PHP directly on your local machine. This is often quick and lightweight to get up and running. Your options:

**Laravel Herd** This is an even easier-to-use local solution not only for Laravel developers on macOS. You can download it. It bundles NGNIX, DnsMasq and some other magic to an easy to use statusbar app. [Herd website](https://herd.laravel.com)

**Laravel Valet** This is an easy-to-use local solution not only for Laravel developers on macOS. You have to install it with the Terminal. It's best installed with Homebrew and it requires Composer. The setup is easier than you think and it aligns with best practices of modern development. It bundles NGNIX, DnsMasq and some other magic to an easy to use CLI. [Docs to install Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet)

**Classical GUIs** These solution stacks are easy to handle through a graphical interface and they interfere with the rest of your system as little as possible. The most commonly used here are [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info) (free and paid version) and [XAAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Please mind that those don't include Git and Composer.

**Manual setup** You can also install and manage the software to run your local web server yourself. You'll find lot's of tutorials searching the web.
