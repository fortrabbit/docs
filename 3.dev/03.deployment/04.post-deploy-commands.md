## Get ready

You have followed the [deployment section](/3.dev/2.deployment/index.md) so far and are ready to deploy code via git using the GitHub integration.

## Architecture

Post deploy commands are similar to [build commands](/3.dev/03.deployment/03.build-commands.md). However, unlike build commands, they only run after a deployment has succeeded. While build commands run in a separate deployment service, post deploy commands execute directly within the environment.

## Use case

- Run database migrations
- Clear caches

## Relation to deployments

Post deploy commands are not covered by the [deployment object](/1.platform/10.objects/11.deployment.md) at the time of this writing. This means a deployment might already show as succeeded while the post deploy commands are still running.

## Preset via software templates

Many [software presets](/1.platform/02.concepts/05.software-templates.md), such as those for Laravel, Symfony and Craft CMS, already include pre-configured post deploy commands.

<!--  TODO: Show examples by single source of truth! -->

## Limits

Post deploy commands are executed using the frontend processes, meaning that CPU-intensive tasks should be used with caution.

## Best practices

Consider the impact before clearing all caches every time, especially in production. Cache clearing not only consumes resources, but cache rebuilding can also significantly slow performance.
