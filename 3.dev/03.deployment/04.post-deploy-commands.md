## Get ready

You have followed the [deployment section](/3.dev/2.deployment/index.md) so far and are ready to deploy code via git using the GitHub integration.

## Architecture

Post deploy commands are similar to [build commands](/3.dev/03.deployment/03.build-commands.md). But they only run after a deployment has succeeded. While build commands run in a separate deployment service, post deploy commands execute directly within the environment.

## Use cases

- **Database migrations**: Apply schema changes after code deployment
- **Cache clearing**: Refresh application caches to reflect new code
- **Configuration updates**: Apply environment-specific settings
- **Search index rebuilding**: Update search indexes with new content structure

## Relation to deployments

Post deploy commands are not covered by the [deployment object](/1.platform/10.objects/11.deployment.md) - at the time of this writing. This means a deployment might already show as succeeded while the post deploy commands are still running.

## Setting up post deploy commands

Post deploy commands are configured in the fortrabbit dashboard for each [app environment](/1.platform/10.objects/2.app-environment.md). You can access these settings through the deployment configuration:

:BlockLink{title="Edit post deploy commands for {{app-env-id}}" path="/environments/{{app-env-id}}/git/post-deploy-commands"}

## Preset via software templates

Many [software presets](/1.platform/02.concepts/05.software-templates.md), such as those for Laravel, Symfony and Craft CMS, already include pre-configured post deploy commands.

### Examples

```bash
# Laravel
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache

# Craft CMS
php craft project-config/apply
php craft clear-caches/all

# Symfony
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod
```

<!--  TODO: Show examples by single source of truth! -->

## Limits

Post deploy commands are executed using the frontend processes, meaning that CPU-intensive tasks should be used with caution.

## Timing and execution

Post deploy commands run after the deployment has been marked as successful. This means:

- If a post deploy command fails, the deployment remains successful
- Commands execute in sequence, not parallel
- Each command must complete before the next one starts
- Total execution time should be kept reasonable to avoid timeouts

## Best practices

- **Cache management:** Consider the impact before clearing all caches every time, especially in production. Cache clearing not only consumes resources, but cache rebuilding can also significantly slow performance.
- **Error handling:** Design your commands to be idempotent (safe to run multiple times) and handle errors gracefully.
- **Monitoring:** Log important post deploy actions so you can troubleshoot issues later.
- **Performance:** Keep commands lightweight and avoid long-running processes that might timeout.
