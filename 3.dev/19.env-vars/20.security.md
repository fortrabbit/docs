navigation.excerpt: Don't expose your env vars ever
lead: ENV vars are the predominant way to configure PHP based websites on a per environment basis. Often sensitive data like database passwords and API keys are stored with ENV vars. Take care to keep your secrets a secret.

## Don't deploy a .env file to production

Best don't deploy your `.env` file to production or anything that is public. The `.env` should really be excluded from Git. Don't deploy it by SSH/SFTP either. When the `.env` is in the root folder, the whole internet can maybe read it by calling `yourdomain.com/.env`.

## Don't expose phpinfo

A phpinfo will expose all environment variables. Make sure not to expose a public phpinfo. Mind that many debugging toolsbars will also include a phpinfo.

## Encode and decode ENV vars

Use a base64 encoded string and decode it when applying it to your configuration in your code. Encoding works like this:

```php
php -r "echo base64_encode('YOUR-M$Pa#A-VALUEx') . PHP_EOL;"
```

And [this example](https://github.com/laravel/ideas/issues/416#issuecomment-280436034) should give you an idea how you can do the decoding.
