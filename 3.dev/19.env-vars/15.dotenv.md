## The .env file

The `.env` file format is a plain text configuration file that lives on top level of your code base. It has `KEY=VALUE` pairs, is easy to write for humans and runtime agnostic. You need an additional parser library, that reads the file and makes the ENV vars accessible from the code base. Here are the most popular .env parsers for PHP:

- [github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) - Everyone
- [github.com/symfony/dotenv](https://github.com/symfony/dotenv) - Symfony

Modern PHP frameworks like [Laravel](/2.guides/2.laravel/1.setup.md) and [Symfony](/2.guides/5.more/8.symfony.md) …) and some CMS like [Craft CMS](/2.guides/3.craft/1.setup.md) use `.env` files for configuration and include a parser already.

## Don't put .env files on the server

Use a `.env` file the local development environment. Use pre-configured ENV vars from the fortrabbit dashboard, add custom ones via the dashboard. BUT PLEASE DON't put `.env` files on fortrabbit. Avoid confusion about conflicting sources and increase security.

Many CMS and frameworks will parse that file automatically. Now depending on the configuration set by the parser, the ENV vars from the `.env` file may or may not overwrite the values provided by the fortrabbit dashboard. To avoid mixed states, either use the ENV vars provided by the dashboard (recommended) or an `.env` file.

We highly recommend to NOT include a `.env` with your Git repo for obvious security concerns. The .env file can include secrets about your application. You can manually create or copy a `.env` file by SSH/SFTP. This might be automated. In that case, you may remove all custom ENV vars from the dashboard. Please see [ENV var security](/3.dev/19.env-vars/11.security.md).
