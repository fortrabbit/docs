title: 500 errors
navigation.excerpt: Internal server error
lead: 'The 500 HTTP status code means "Internal Server Error". This article aims to help developers troubleshooting 500 errors.'
---

- 500 errors will usually be shown on screen immediately
- 500 errors often occur after code or configuration changes
- 500 errors are sometimes just printed as a "service unavailable" message, check the browser's developer tools for the response's HTTP status code to be sure this is indeed a 500 error
- 500 errors here are often rendered using a fortrabbit error page template

**In most cases this is not a server issue, but something with your code and configuration.** Good news is that they are mostly easy to debug for you:

## Check the logs

Examine the logs of your App. See [here](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md). There you'll likely find where the application exited with which error.

## Review your latest changes

Since 500 errors often appear during installation, setup or code changes: Review your code and configuration changes. Compare this with your [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) and see if it fails the same way. Have you ran an update recently?

### Check your .htaccess file

Our experience in support shows us that many 500 errors are caused by wrong rules in your `.htaccess` file. See our [main article on `.htaccess`](/3.dev/htaccess/1.intro.md) for some background. Have you made any changes to `.htaccess` lately?

## It could also be something on our side

It is also possible — although less likely - that this error is caused by a network, hardware or configuration issue on our side, your hosting provider. Please check our status page under [status.fortrabbit.com](https://status.fortrabbit.com) if there are any ongoing maintenance windows or service issues known.
