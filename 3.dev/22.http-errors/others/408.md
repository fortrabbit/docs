lead: The 408 HTTP status code means "Request Timeout" and it is very rare.

The server timed out waiting for the request to complete.

## 408 error behavior

- 408 errors will usually be shown on screen after a delay
- 408 errors can occur when the client connection is slow or unstable
- 408 errors can be rendered using a fortrabbit error page template

**In most cases this is not a server issue, but a problem with the client connection or request handling.** Please check the following common issues first.

## Slow client connections

A common cause of 408 errors is when the client takes too long to send the complete request. This can happen with:

- Slow internet connections
- Large file uploads that exceed timeout limits
- Mobile connections with poor signal quality
- Network interruptions during the request

## Large request payloads

When uploading large files or sending requests with substantial data:

- Check if your upload exceeds the maximum allowed size
- Consider breaking large uploads into smaller chunks
- Verify that your application properly handles multipart uploads
- Review PHP settings like `max_execution_time` and `upload_max_filesize`

## Client-side timeout configuration

Sometimes the issue is with how the client application handles requests:

- Check your application's HTTP client timeout settings
- Ensure your JavaScript fetch or AJAX calls have appropriate timeout values
- Review any proxy or CDN timeout configurations
- Consider implementing retry logic for important requests

## Check the logs

Examine the logs. See [here](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md). The logs may show patterns of when these timeouts occur and help identify the root cause.

## Network troubleshooting

- Test your connection speed and stability
- Try the same request from a different network
- Check if the issue occurs consistently or only sporadically
- Monitor your application during peak traffic times

## It could also be something on our side

It is also possible — although less likely - that this error is caused by a network, hardware or configuration issue on our side, your hosting provider. Please check our status page under [status.fortrabbit.com](https://status.fortrabbit.com) if there are any ongoing maintenance windows or service issues known.
