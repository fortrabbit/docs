The server was reached but rejected the request before it reached your application logic. Understand and fix 400 responses on fortrabbit.

## 400 error behavior

- 400 errors appear immediately after the browser sends the request
- They often surface during integration work with third-party services or new client-side code that posts JSON or form data
- They can be triggered by your application framework, by a reverse proxy, or by the fortrabbit edge when the request is malformed

**Most 400 responses indicate something is wrong with the request that is sent, not with the platform itself.** Work through the following checks first:

## Check the request that is sent

- Inspect the request in your browser developer tools or with `curl -v`.
- Ensure the `Host` header matches your App domain. Requests to the wrong hostname or without TLS will be rejected.
- Validate query strings and payloads: truncated JSON bodies, illegal characters, or an unexpected content type will cause a 400.

## Review application level validation

- Many frameworks respond with 400 when CSRF tokens or form validations fail. Confirm that cookies, sessions, and CSRF headers are present.
- Double-check any custom middleware you added. Rate limiters and API gateways frequently send a 400 when a prerequisite header (API key, signature) is missing.
- Compare with your local environment: reproduce the failing request locally to see if the framework reports the same problem.

## Check the logs

- Application and web server logs will often mention the exact reason. See [Logs](/1.platform/06.settings/25.logs.md) for where to find them.
- Consider enabling verbose logging temporarily to capture raw request details (remember to disable again afterwards).

## It could also be something on our side

Less common, but still possible: a transient network hiccup or edge misconfiguration could cause 400 responses. Have a look at [status.fortrabbit.com](https://status.fortrabbit.com) for active incidents, and contact support if everything above checks out and the issue persists.
