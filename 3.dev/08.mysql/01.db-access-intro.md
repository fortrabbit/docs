## Get ready

To connect to the remote MySQL database, it first need to be booked. The [MySQL component](/platform/components/mysql) is optional but pre-booked for database driven software systems.

To be able to connect to the remote database from your computer, also a [local development environment](/3.dev/20.how-to/1.local-development.md) with `mysql` and `mysqldump` is required for terminal usage. A database GUI such as Workbench or Sequel Ace is another option. Different local development environments come with different paradigms for working with a database. For containerized systems, the database service might not be directly exposed.

## Next steps

- [Connect from within the environment](/3.dev/08.mysql/04.access-environment.md)
- [Database access via terminal from local](/3.dev/08.mysql/02.db-access-local-terminal.md)
  - [Database up via terminal](/3.dev/08.mysql/08.database-up-terminal.md)
  - [Database down via terminal](/3.dev/08.mysql/09.database-down-terminal.md)
- [Database access via GUI from local](/3.dev/08.mysql/03.db-access-local-gui.md)
  - [Database up via GUI](/3.dev/08.mysql/10.database-up-gui.md)
  - [Database down via GUI](/3.dev/08.mysql/11.database-down-gui.md)
