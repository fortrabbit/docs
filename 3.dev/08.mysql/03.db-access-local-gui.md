fortrabbit requires a database connection via SSH tunnel. This is a standard procedure. All clients support that. Usually there is a tab for that kind of access setting, enter the SSH connection details and the database access credentials from the dashboard.

## Example connection settings

- **SSH Host**: `ssh.{{region}}.frbit.app`
- **SSH User**: `{{app-env-id}}`
- **SSH Keyfile**: Your local SSH private key
- **MySQL Host**: `mysql.{{app-env-id}}.svc`
- **MySQL Server Port**: `3306`
- **Username**: `{{app-env-id}}`
- **Password**: Look it up in the dashboard
- **Default Schema**: `{{app-env-id}}`

The MySQL hostname is the remote server: `mysql.{{app-env-id}}.svc`.

## Troubleshooting

The most common issues setting up the remote connection via database GUI are:

- Connect via SSH tunnel, there is a tab for that
- The remote database server is not localhost

## Why use a database GUI at all?

Using a database graphical user interface has many benefits Visually browse and edit the database, get hints running queries, save connection details as bookmarks. It's also practical to have the client connect to the remote and to the local database.

### Database GUI clients
