lead: It's considered bad practice to install phpMyAdmin on fortrabbit. However, you can also manage the remote MySQL with a local phpMyAdmin installation.

## Configure local phpMyAdmin

Add an additional server configuration to your local phpMyAdmin `config.inc.php` file like so:

```raw
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['verbose']      = '{{app-env-id}}';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']         = '127.0.0.1';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port']         = '13306'; // like specified with tunnel command
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type'] = 'tcp';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension']    = 'mysqli';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['compress']     = FALSE;
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']    = 'cookie';
$i++;
```

Then open a terminal tunnel, then visit your local phpMyAdmin in the browser. You will be asked for the MySQL user and password. Using a local phpMyAdmin with your remote database requires you to always open a tunnel first.

## Why not install phpMyAdmin on fortrabbit

**Security**: Don't expose a UI to access your production database. **Practical reasons**: Don't pollute your git or keep the remote out of sync.

## Better alternatives

Connect to the remote database from your machine directly.
