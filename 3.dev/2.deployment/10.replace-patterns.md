This is essential to avoid old files cluttering the system and confusing the software. This setting is only available when the [deployment strategy](/3.dev/2.deployment/7.strategy.md) is set to 'merge'. Note that with the merge strategy, all files from the deployment build will synced into the content of the actual web storage. No old files will be deleted.

For certain folders, it's better to delete their content.

Sensible defaults based on [software templates](/1.platform/11.concepts/software-templates.md) are provided. Rsync syntax is supported.

## Examples

```yml
## Craft CMS
/config/project
```

When the [deployment strategy](/3.dev/2.deployment/7.strategy.md) is set to replace, there is an opposite setting to define [exclude patterns](/3.dev/2.deployment/9.exclude-patterns.md).
