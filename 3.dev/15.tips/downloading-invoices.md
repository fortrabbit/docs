## A - See your mailbox

Search your e-mail inbox for "fortrabbit invoice". Each invoice e-mail contains a secret link to the invoice. From there you can print or download the invoice.

## B - Download from the dashboard

Login to the fortrabbit dashboard. Navigate to the payment method and see the invoice archive. The payment method needs to be active and you need to have access on that payment method to do this.

Invoices are shown as HTML. Depending on support in your browser, a PDF can be generated using the "Print to File" feature from your Browser/OS.
