A common misconception is that a powerful web server alone will make a website run fast. While we provide scalable hosting services, it's important to understand that simply adding more hosting power won't necessarily improve performance. Effective performance requires understanding and coding skills. You, the web developer, have most responsibility when it comes to website performance. Good code can fly.

## Not all websites are alike

Your milage may vary. For some websites or pages, an execution time of 500 ms might be acceptable, while for others it might not be. Individually built websites have unique performance patterns as well.

We support a wide range of different applications using software systems such as Laravel, Symfony, Craft CMS, WordPress and many more.

## Performance problems not related to PHP

Even with PHP based websites and web applications, PHP is not the only possible source of a slow website.

- Frontend issues: fat assets, blocking requests …
- Hosting problems: bad neighbors, old hardware, cramped servers …
