## Use cases

SFTP is commonly used by novice developers to upload code. Sometimes it's helpful to look up something quickly. It's not a good practice but get's the job done.

## SFTP access details

```raw
Host:       deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com
User name:  {{ssh-user}}
Password:   No password required, your private SSH key will be used
Protocol:   SFTP (not FTP)
Port:       22
```

## SFTP clients

There are various SFTP clients out there. We recommend [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (on Mac and Windows). Modern editors and IDEs have support for SFTP, including VS Code, Sublime, PhpStorm, Notepad++ and so on.

## SFTP is not FTP

SFTP is short for SSH File Transfer Protocol. It is used for uploading and downloading files over a SSH connection. Despite the similar name, SFTP is very different than FTP or FTPS internally, but for most practical purposes they are very similar. SFTP is preferable to FTP because the the transferred data is encrypted and not visible to everyone on the network.

## Alternatives

- [Git deployment](/3.dev/2.deployment/1.intro.md)
- [SSH](/3.dev/7.code-access/3.ssh.md)
- [rsync](/3.dev/rsync.md)
