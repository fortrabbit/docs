## New platform URLs

The new platform version is now live and open for everyone to use. Experience a redesigned fortrabbit. It will feel new, yet familiar. Existing clients can use their login credentials to login, see the [migration plan](/1.new-platform/2.migration.md). Also see the [changes](/1.new-platform/3.changes.md) on what to expect.

## Legacy platform URLs

The legacy platform is also still open and fully functional and will receive full support. There is no rush and we aim to make the switch as seamless as possible. The legacy platform is going to be slowly phased out. See our [migration plan](/1.new-platform/2.migration.md) for details and timing. The access will stay the same:
