<!-- Challenge: Try to manage multiple websites, maybe with teams of developers, maybe with different clients. Setting up separate accounts and sharing login details leads to a messy situation. A multi-client model that maps to your real world business relationship requirements in nearly any context will allow you manage projects with ease. -->

## Use cases

Collaboration features are aimed to fit the needs of professional web developers in small to medium sized enterprises. Workflows to deal with all hosting aspects from code sharing to billing for the following kind of business relations are covered:

- Solo freelancers working for clients directly
- Solo freelancers working for organizations
- Smaller organizations with a fixed team, maybe plus external freelancers
- Bigger organizations with multiple teams, maybe plus external freelancers

An organization can be a web agency, a startup, a regular business, a campaign, an association, a non profit. In many cases the billing manager is not a developer. This can be the client or someone from the billing department.

## Terminology and structure

| [Person](/13.objects/3.person.md) | [Team](/13.objects/4.team.md)      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| a human being with an account     | a group of developers              |
| is actively managing              | is passively managed by developers |
| is developer or client            | —                                  |

| [App](/13.objects/1.app.md)        | [Payment method](/13.objects/9.payment-method.md) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| a website or web application       | an object owning apps                             |
| is passively managed by developers | is passively managed by people                    |

## Understanding personal access

When signing up for fortrabbit, we ask for your first and last name. An account is for an individual, not a company. With an account, you can log in, manage apps and teams, and be part of multiple teams.

Don't share your fortrabbit account. It's private for you. It's for you with all your personal access using [public SSH keys](/12.dev-tips/8.ssh-keys.md) and your unique access to the dashboard.

### Personal access on app environments

In classical hosting you have one set of server access credentials for SFTP/SSH which you then have to share. With fortrabbit it's better: each account has it's own personal access to each App.

```
┌───────────┐            ┌──────────────────┐
│           │            │                  │
│  person1  ├───access───▶                  │
│           │            │                  │
└───────────┘            │       app        │
┌───────────┐            │   environment1   │
│           │            │   environment2   │
│  person2  ├───access───▶                  │
│           │            │                  │
└───────────┘            └──────────────────┘
```

Instead of sending an e-mail with a FTP password to another developer, you are sending an invitation to create a free account and to get instant personal access to the apps. This is more secure, more transparent and easier to handle.

## Levels of team collaboration

```plain
