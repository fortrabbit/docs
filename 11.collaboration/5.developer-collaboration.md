## Personal access

Recap: A [fortrabbit account](/13.objects/3.person.md) is a **personal** access to the platform, through the dashboard, but also by [direct code access](/7.code-access/1.intro.md) and [deployment](/6.deployment/1.intro.md). Personal access means that the access should be limited to one person in real live and not shared.

## Levels of collaboration

### A - No collaboration

Are you the one woman army? Maybe you are using fortrabbit to host your own projects here - maybe a personal blog, or some weekend project. In that case you just create [apps](/13.objects/1.app.md) that only you have access on and create a [payment method](/13.objects/9.payment-method.md) that only you can access.

### B - Direct collaboration with other developers on app level

### C - Collaborating with clients

### D - Team collaboration
