## 1. Sign up

Create a free personal account over at our dashboard. We won't spam you.

During boarding you will be guided to create your first app. Choose the [free trial](/11.concepts/2.free-trial.md) for a quick test drive.

## 3. Explore

Explore all the settings in the dashboard. Login by [SSH](/7.code-access/3.ssh.md) or [SFTP](/7.code-access/4.sftp.md). [Deploy](/6.deployment/1.intro.md) some code. Browse our [docs](/) here. [Contact us](/20.get-help/2.contact-us.md) if you have a question or want to leave feedback.

## 4. Start for real

If you like what you see, [migrate existing](/14.tips/migrate-to-fortrabbit.md) or start new projects here. Invite other developers or your clients to [collaborate](//15.collaboration/1.intro.md) here.
