We recommend to use rsync to upload or download new contents to and from your remote fortrabbit app environment. See also our [rsync article](/15.tips/rsync.md). On your local computer in the Terminal in the kirby project folder execute:

```shell
# SYNC UP: from local to remote
$ rsync -av {{app-env-slug}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com:~
```

It works also the other way around. For example in a case, where you have done some edits online and want those changes to be reflected in your local development environment:

```bash
# SYNC DOWN: from remote to local
$ rsync -av {{app-env-slug}}@deploy.{{region}}.frbit.com:~ ./
```
