excerpt:    Live code examples

When you have your app environment ready at fortrabbit and you are currently logged in the Dashboard, the help pages here will show you [live code examples](access-methods#the-code-example-helper) matching the settings for your individual App, so you can easily copy/paste them.

## The code example helper

When you are currently logged in to the Dashboard (a cookie is stored), you will see a yellow box on the right side here - with a select to choose one of your Apps. This helper knows which authentication method your Account uses. It also changes all code examples on the current page according to the selected App. So you can literary copy/paste all code examples here.
