## Starting a new trial

1. Sign in to the dashboard
2. Find the "Create an app" button with the dashboard
3. Follow the process to create an app, choose the free trial option

## Trial limits

- The trial is limited in time
- [Components](/14.concepts/components.md) are only available in the smallest plans

## Extending the trial time

The default trial time is short. A timer in the dashboard with the app will show you the time left. Additionally, you can contact us to extend your trial time. Write us something about your goals with the trial and we are happy to extend your trial time.

## Upgrading the trial

You can, of course, upgrade from your trial to a paid plan at any time. You can do so under your App's overview.

## The end of a trial

When setting an app in trial mode you can define what shall happen when the trial period ends:

- opt-in: the trial app will be deleted at the end, upgrade any time before
- opt-out: the trial app will be upgraded to paid after the trial ends, cancel any time before

## Collaborating with the trial

You can add a team to the trial app as well.

## Restarting a trial

You can start a new trial app, once the last one is expired. The trial can thus also be used for small experiments.
