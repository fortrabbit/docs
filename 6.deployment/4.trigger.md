### Push to deploy

This is the default trigger. Deployment happens automatically on every push to the branch that is connected to the environment.

### Manual

When manual deployment is selected, no automatic deployments will happen. To trigger a deployment one need to initiate the deployment from the [dashboard](/11.concepts/dashboard.md) by clicking the deploy now button with the environment.
