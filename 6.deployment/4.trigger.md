## Push to deploy

This is the default trigger. Deployment happens automatically on every push to the branch that is connected to the environment.

## Manual deployment

When manual deployment is selected, no automatic deployments will happen. Initiate a deployment from the [dashboard](/11.concepts/dashboard.md).

## Deploy now button

Trigger a new deployment for an environment, based on the latest commit. You will find a 'deploy now button' with the deployment settings of the environment and with the deployment that is based on the latest commit. This will use the latest commit as the source and apply all deployment related settings.

:DashboardLink{title="Deploy {{app-env-slug}} now" path="/confirm/environment-deploy?environment={{app-env-slug}}"}

The deploy now action is shown with both deployment trigger settings. Deploying a commit again can be useful when a setting related to deployment has changed. To avoid inconstant states, it is not allowed to deploy an older commit again.
