In regard of deployment, Git is not only used as a version control system, but also as a transport layer to copy over the delta of the latest code changes. A typical code deployment on fortrabbit consists of the following deployment pipeline:

1. Receive code updates from version control
2. Do build steps
    1. Update dependencies via Composer
    2. Build assets (JavaScript, CSS …) via Node.js
    3. Migrate the database schema
    4. Clear the cache
3. Upload the deploy package into the web space
