## What's code deployment anyhow?

We define code deployment as a multi-step process to deliver code from your local computer to a web server in a reliable and automated fashion.

## Code deployment for PHP projects

A PHP project code deployment may consists of the following steps:

1. Receiving code updates from version control
2. Updating dependencies via Composer
3. Building web assets (JavaScript, CSS …) via Node.js
4. Migrating the database schema
5. Clearing the cache

## The role of Git in deployment

In regard of deployment, Git is not only used as a version control system, but also as a transport layer to copy over the delta of the latest code changes.

## The role of Composer in deployment

Most PHP development is done with the help of frameworks or content management systems. These are usually installed as a dependency and themselves using other dependencies. All that code is not part of Git, so when the code get's delivered, those dependencies need to be installed or updated for the given environment. Find more details with our [Composer article](/11.dev-tips/3.composer.md).

## Node.js build steps in deployment

Most web development is done with the help of Javascript build tooling. Specific production build steps create optimized build bundles to be served to clients from the web application.

## Environments in deployment

In the most basic setup, you have two environments:

1. Your local development environment - latest changes com from here
2. An app environment - live website where code is received

Learn more about environments with our [app environments](/12.platform/3.environment/intro.md) and multi staging article.
