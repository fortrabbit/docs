This is essential to preserve user uploads, assets, and other user-generated content. This setting is only available when the [deployment strategy](/6.deployment/7.strategy.md) is set to 'replace'. Note that with the replace strategy, all files from the deployment build will replace the content of the actual web storage.

Generally, you want to exclude runtime data (files and folder created by the website not with git). Usually this about user uploads, logs, sessions.

Sensible defaults based on [software templates](/11.concepts/software-templates.md) are provided. Rsync syntax is supported.

## Examples

```yml
## WordPress
/wp-content

## Craft CMS
/config/project

## Laravel
/storage
```
